While the famine had ended by\nthe late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his\ntenure. Kim strengthened the role of the\n[military](Korean_People's_Army \"wikilink\") by his\n*[Songun](Songun \"wikilink\")* (\\\"military-first\\\") policies, making the\narmy the central organizer of civil society. Kim\\'s rule also saw\ntentative economic reforms, including the opening of the [Kaesong\nIndustrial Park](Kaesong_Industrial_Park \"wikilink\") in 2003. In April\n2009, [North Korea\\'s\nconstitution](North_Korea's_constitution \"wikilink\") was amended to\nrefer to him and his successors as the \\\"supreme leader of the DPRK\\\".\nThe most common colloquial [title given to\nKim](List_of_Kim_Jong_Il's_titles \"wikilink\") during his lifetime was\n\\\"Dear Leader\\\" to distinguish him from his father Kim Il Sung, the\n\\\"Great Leader\\\". Following Kim\\'s failure to appear at important public\nevents in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen\nseriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government\nannounced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son,\nKim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and\nsucceeded him. After his death, alongside \\\"Eternal General Secretary\\\"\nof the WPK, Kim Jong Il was declared \\\"Eternal Chairman\\\" of the now\ndefunct [National Defence\nCommission](National_Defence_Commission \"wikilink\"), in keeping with\n[the tradition of establishing eternal\nposts](Eternal_leaders_of_North_Korea \"wikilink\") for the dead members\nof the [Kim dynasty](Kim_family_(North_Korea) \"wikilink\"). North Korean\nmedia also began referring to Kim as \\\"the General\\\" (*Changun*),\nsimilar to his father\\'s posthumous designation as \\\"the \\[eternal\\]\nPresident\\\".[^2]",
  "Early life {#early_life}": "Soviet records show that Kim Jong Il was born Yuri Kim.[^3][^4][^5] In\nliterature, it is assumed that he was born in 1941 in either the camp of\n[Vyatskoye](Vyatskoye,_Khabarovsk_Krai \"wikilink\"), near\n[Khabarovsk](Khabarovsk \"wikilink\"),[^6]`{{failed verification|date=July 2024}}`{=mediawiki}\nor camp Voroshilov near [Nikolsk](Ussurijsk \"wikilink\").[^7] According\nto Lim Jae Cheon, Kim cannot have been born in Vyatskoye as Kim Il\nSung\\'s war records show that he arrived at Vyatskoye only in July 1942\nand had been living in Voroshilov before, thus Kim Jong Il is generally\nagreed to have been born in Voroshilov.[^8] Kim\\'s mother, [Kim Jong\nSuk](Kim_Jong-suk \"wikilink\"), was Kim Il Sung\\'s first wife. Inside his\nfamily, he was nicknamed \\\"Yura\\\",[^9] while his younger brother [Kim\nMan Il](Kim_Man-il \"wikilink\") (born Aleksandr Kim) was nicknamed\n\\\"Shura\\\".[^10]\nKim\\'s official biography states he was born in a [secret military\ncamp](Paektusan_Secret_Camp \"wikilink\") on [Paektu\nMountain](Paektu_Mountain \"wikilink\")\n(`{{Korean|백두산밀영고향집|context=north}}`{=mediawiki}; *Baekdusan\nMiryeong Gohyang jip*) in [Chōsen](Chōsen \"wikilink\") on 16 February\n1942.`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|p=1}}`{=mediawiki}\nAccording to one comrade of Kim\\'s mother, Lee Min, word of Kim\\'s birth\nfirst reached an army camp in Vyatskoye via radio and that both Kim and\nhis mother did not return there until the following\nyear.`{{sfn|Breen|2012|p=45}}`{=mediawiki}[^11] Kim Jong Suk died in\n1949 from an ectopic pregnancy.[^12]\nIn 1945, Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea\nregained [independence from\nJapan](Korea_under_Japanese_rule \"wikilink\"). His father returned to\n[Pyongyang](Pyongyang \"wikilink\") that September, and in late November\nKim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at\n[Sonbong](Sonbong \"wikilink\"). The family moved into a former Japanese\nofficer\\'s mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool. Kim\\'s brother\ndrowned there in 1948.[^13]\nAccording to his official biography, Kim completed the course of general\neducation between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary\nSchool No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 ([Namsan Higher Middle\nSchool](Namsan_Senior_High_School \"wikilink\")) in\nPyongyang.[^14]`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|pp=5–6}}`{=mediawiki}\nThis is contested by foreign academics, who believe he is more likely to\nhave received his early education in the People\\'s Republic of China as\na precaution to ensure his safety during the [Korean\nWar](Korean_War \"wikilink\").[^15]`{{Page needed|date=January 2022}}`{=mediawiki}\nThroughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in\nthe Korean Children\\'s Union and the Democratic Youth League of North\nKorea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and\nother literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his\nmiddle school\\'s DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He\npursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage\ngreater ideological education among his\nclassmates.`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|pp=7–9}}`{=mediawiki}\nKim is also said to have received English language education in\n[Malta](Malta \"wikilink\") in the early 1970s[^16][^17] on his infrequent\nholidays there as a guest of Prime Minister [Dom\nMintoff](Dom_Mintoff \"wikilink\").[^18]\nThe elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son, [Kim Pyong\nIl](Kim_Pyong-il \"wikilink\"). Since 1988, Kim Pyong Il has served in a\nseries of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean\nambassador to [Poland](Poland \"wikilink\"). Foreign commentators suspect\nthat Kim Pyong Il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order\nto avoid a power struggle between his two sons.[^19]",
  "Ascension to power {#ascension_to_power}": "Kim Jong Il officially joined the Workers\\' Party of Korea in July\n1961.[^20] He rose up the ranks during the 1960s,[^21] and benefited\ngreatly from the [Kapsan Faction\nIncident](Kapsan_Faction_Incident \"wikilink\") around 1967, which was the\nlast credible challenge to Kim Il Sung\\'s rule.[^22] This incident\nmarked the first time Kim Jong Il was -- at age 26 -- given official\nduties by his father, when the younger Kim took part in the\ninvestigation and purges that followed the incident.[^23]\nIn addition, Kim Jong Il gave a speech at the plenum; it was his first\nas a figure of authority. Kim Jong Il\\'s name was also mentioned in\npublic documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that Kim Il\nSung might have already planned for Jong Il to succeed him as\nleader.[^24][^25]\nOnly six months after, in an unscheduled meeting of the party, Kim Il\nSung called for loyalty in the film industry that had betrayed him with\n*An Act of\nSincerity*.`{{efn|''An Act of Sincerity'', described variously as either a film or a stage play, was produced by Kim To-man after the death of Choe Chae-ryon, the wife of Kapsan Faction leader [[Pak Kum-chol]].

Reportedly, Kim Il Sung\nwas infuriated and Pyong Il thus fell out of favor, strengthening Kim\nJong Il\\'s position.[^38] In 1979, Kim Pyong Il began a series of\ndiplomatic postings in [Europe](Europe \"wikilink\"), arranged so as then\nhe couldn\\'t influence politics in North Korea.[^39] Kim Pyong Il only\nreturned to North Korea in 2019.[^40]\nAccording to Kim Jong Il\\'s official biography, the Central Committee\nalready appointed him successor to Kim Il Sung in 1974.

Kim was regularly hailed by the media\nas the \\\"fearless leader\\\" and \\\"the great successor to the\nrevolutionary cause\\\". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his\nfather in North Korea.\nBy the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic\nstagnation. Kim Il Sung\\'s policy of *[Juche](Juche \"wikilink\")*\n(self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even\nwith its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China.

Asian\nstock markets fell soon after the announcement, due to similar\nconcerns.[^128]\nOn 12 January 2012, North Korea called Kim the \\\"eternal leader\\\" and\nannounced that his body would be preserved and displayed at Pyongyang\\'s\n[Kumsusan Memorial Palace](Kumsusan_Memorial_Palace \"wikilink\").\nOfficials also announced plans to install statues, portraits, and\n\\\"towers to his immortality\\\" across the country.[^129][^130] His\nbirthday of 16 February was declared \\\"the greatest auspicious holiday\nof the nation\\\" and was named the Day of the Shining Star.[^131]\nIn February 2012, on what would have been his 71st birthday, Kim was\nposthumously made [Dae Wonsu](Dae_Wonsu \"wikilink\") (usually translated\nas *[Generalissimo](Generalissimo \"wikilink\")*, literally [Grand\nMarshal](Grand_Marshal \"wikilink\")), the nation\\'s top military rank.

She was handpicked by his father and married to him in 1966. They\nhad a daughter called Kim Hye\nKyung,`{{sfn|Breen|2012|p=64}}`{=mediawiki} who was born in 1968. Soon\nafterwards, they divorced in 1969.\nKim\\'s first mistress, [Song Hye Rim](Song_Hye-rim \"wikilink\"), was a\nstar of North Korean films. She was already married to another man and\nwith a child when they met.[^137] Kim is reported to have forced her\nhusband to divorce her. This relationship, which started in 1970, was\nnot officially recognized. They had one son, Kim Jong Nam (1971--2017),\nwho was Kim Jong Il\\'s eldest son. Kim kept both the relationship and\nthe child a secret (even from his father) until he ascended to power in\n1994.[^138][^139] However, after years of estrangement, Song is believed\nto have died in Moscow in the [Central Clinical\nHospital](Central_Clinical_Hospital \"wikilink\") in 2002.[^140]\nKim\\'s official wife, [Kim Young Sook](Kim_Young-sook \"wikilink\"), was\nthe daughter of a high-ranking military official.

She traveled with Kim on a secretive trip\nto China in January 2006, where she was received by Chinese officials as\nKim\\'s wife.[^147]\nAccording to Michael Breen, author of the book *Kim Jong Il: North\nKorea\\'s Dear Leader*, the women intimately linked to Kim never acquired\nany power or influence of consequence. As he explains, their roles were\nlimited to that of romance and domesticity.[^148]\nHe had a younger sister, [Kim Kyong Hui](Kim_Kyong-hui \"wikilink\").
