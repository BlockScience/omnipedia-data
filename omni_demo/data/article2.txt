He led North Korea from [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|the death]] of his father [[Kim Il Sung]] in 1994 until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong Il|his death]] in 2011, when he was succeeded by his son, [[Kim Jong Un]]. Afterwards, Kim Jong Il was declared [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|Eternal General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK).

In the early 1980s, Kim had become the [[heir apparent]] for the leadership of North Korea, thus being established the [[Kim family (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]], and he assumed important posts in party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, following [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|his death]] in 1994. Kim was the [[General Secretary of the WPK]], [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Presidium]], [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman]] of the [[National Defence Commission]] (NDC) of North Korea and the [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]] (KPA), the [[List of countries by number of troops|fourth-largest standing army]] in the world.

While the famine had ended by the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the [[Korean People's Army|military]] by his ''[[Songun]]'' ("military-first") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society. Kim's rule also saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the [[Kaesong Industrial Park]] in 2003. In April 2009, [[North Korea's constitution]] was amended to refer to him and his successors as the "supreme leader of the DPRK".

The most common colloquial [[List of Kim Jong Il's titles|title given to Kim]] during his lifetime was "Dear Leader" to distinguish him from his father Kim Il Sung, the "Great Leader". Following Kim's failure to appear at important public events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and succeeded him. After his death, alongside "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK, Kim Jong Il was declared "Eternal Chairman" of the now defunct [[National Defence Commission]], in keeping with [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|the tradition of establishing eternal posts]] for the dead members of the [[Kim family (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. North Korean media also began referring to Kim as "the General" (''Changun''), similar to his father's posthumous designation as "the [eternal] President".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kim |first=Jong Un |title=Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party: Talk to Senior Officials of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea |url=http://www.korean-books.com.kp/en/packages/xnps/download.pg.php?122#.pdf |access-date=9 May 2018 |date=6 April 2012 |publisher=[[Foreign Languages Publishing House (North Korea)|Foreign Languages Publishing House]] |location=Pyongyang |oclc=988748608 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162207/http://www.korean-books.com.kp/en/packages/xnps/download.pg.php?122#.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live |quote=...{{nbsp}}an epoch-making event that establishes an important milestone in holding up General Kim Jong Il, together with President Kim Il Sung, as the eternal leader of our Party, and in carrying out the ideology and cause of the President and the General with credit.}}</ref>

In 1945, Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea regained [[Korea under Japanese rule|independence from Japan]]. His father returned to [[Pyongyang]] that September, and in late November Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at [[Sonbong]]. The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool. Kim's brother drowned there in 1948.<ref name=post>{{cite book|title=Leaders and their followers in a dangerous world: the psychology of political behavior|last=Post|first=Jerrold M.|author2=Alexander George|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leaderstheirfoll0000post/page/243 243–244]|year=2004|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=978-0801441691|url=https://archive.org/details/leaderstheirfoll0000post/page/243}}</ref>

=== Education ===
According to his official biography, Kim completed the course of general education between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary School No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 ([[Namsan Senior High School|Namsan Higher Middle School]]) in Pyongyang.<ref name="OhHassig2004">{{cite book|author1=Kongdan Oh|author2=Ralph C.

(2004). ''Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader'', New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0312322216}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2022}}

Throughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in the Korean Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He pursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates.{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|pp=7–9}}

Kim is also said to have received English language education in [[Malta]] in the early 1970s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111220/local/The-Dear-Leader-s-secret-stay-in-Malta.399242|title=The Dear Leader's secret stay in Malta|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|website=Times of Malta|date=20 December 2011 |language=en-GB|access-date=4 April 2019|archive-date=4 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404130549/https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111220/local/The-Dear-Leader-s-secret-stay-in-Malta.399242|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nknews.org/2014/06/kim-jong-ils-unlikely-maltese-mentor-a-secret-military-agreement/ |title=Kim Jong Il's unlikely Maltese mentor & a secret military agreement|date=11 June 2014|publisher=[[NK News]] – North Korea News|language=en-US|access-date=4 April 2019|archive-date=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417033152/https://www.nknews.org/2014/06/kim-jong-ils-unlikely-maltese-mentor-a-secret-military-agreement/|url-status=live}}</ref> on his infrequent holidays there as a guest of Prime Minister [[Dom Mintoff]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Preston |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,866479,00.html|title=Kim is a baby rattling the sides of a cot|work=The Guardian|date=30 December 2002|access-date=28 December 2011|location=London |archive-date=4 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004095640/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/30/comment.peterpreston|url-status=live}}</ref>

The elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son, [[Kim Pyong-il|Kim Pyong Il]]. Since 1988, Kim Pyong Il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to [[Poland]]. Foreign commentators suspect that Kim Pyong Il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order to avoid a power struggle between his two sons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FB14Dg04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040213164807/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/FB14Dg04.html|url-status=unfit|archive-date=13 February 2004|title=Happy Birthday, Dear Leader – who's next in line?|work=Asia Times|date=14 February 2004|access-date=28 December 2011}}</ref>

In addition, Kim Jong Il gave a speech at the plenum; it was his first as a figure of authority. Kim Jong Il's name was also mentioned in public documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that Kim Il Sung might have already planned for Jong Il to succeed him as leader.<ref>Lim Jae-Cheon, ''Leader Symbols and Personality Cult in North Korea: The Leader State'' (New York: Taylor & Francis, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1317567400}}.</ref><ref name="Lim Jae-Cheon 2008">Lim Jae-Cheon, Kim Jong-il's Leadership of North Korea (New York: Routledge, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1134017126}}, pp. 38–47.</ref>

According to Kim Jong Il's official biography, the Central Committee already appointed him successor to Kim Il Sung in 1974.

=== Heir apparent ===
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2021}}
By the time of the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|Sixth Party Congress]] in October 1980, Kim's control of the Party operation was complete. He was given senior posts in the [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Military Commission]] and the party [[Secretariat of the Workers' Party of Korea|Secretariat]]. When he was made a member of the [[1982 North Korean parliamentary election|Seventh Supreme People's Assembly]] in February 1982, international observers deemed him the [[heir apparent]] of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he had no public profile and was referred to only as the "Party Centre".{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=127}} At this time Kim assumed the title "Dear Leader" ({{korean|hangul=친애하는 지도자|mr=ch'inaehanŭn jidoja|context=north}}),<ref name="dear">{{Cite web|date=19 November 2004 |title=North Korea's dear leader less dear |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/north-koreas-dear-leader-less-dear-20041119-gdz0y6.html|access-date=5 June 2023|website=The Age |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213145724/http://www.theage.com.au/news/North-Korea/North-Koreas-dear-leader-less-dear/2004/11/18/1100748136912.html |archive-date=13 February 2007}}</ref> and the government began building a [[personality cult]] around him patterned after that of his father, the "Great Leader". Kim was regularly hailed by the media as the "fearless leader" and "the great successor to the revolutionary cause". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea.

By the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation. Kim Il Sung's policy of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even with its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China. South Korea accused Kim of ordering the [[Rangoon bombing|1983 bombing in Rangoon]], Burma which killed 17 visiting South Korean officials, including four cabinet members, and another in 1987 which killed all 115 onboard [[Korean Air Flight 858]].<ref name="yangon">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/asia/northkorea/keyplayers/kimjongil.html "North Korea: Nuclear Standoff"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103133000/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/asia/northkorea/keyplayers/kimjongil.html |date=3 January 2014 }}, ''The Online NewsHour'', [[PBS]], 19 October 2006.</ref> A North Korean agent, [[Kim Hyon-hui|Kim Hyon Hui]], confessed to planting a bomb in the case of the second, saying the operation was ordered by Kim personally.<ref name="hyonhui">{{Cite news |date=16 December 2004 |title=Fake ashes, very real North Korean sanctions |url=http://atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FL16Dh02.html|newspaper=Asia Times Online|first=Kosuke|last=Takahashi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216133117/http://atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FL16Dh02.html |archive-date=16 December 2004 }}</ref>

On 24 December 1991, Kim was also named [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16325390|title=Kim Jong-un 'supreme commander'|date=24 December 2011|access-date=6 January 2020|language=en-GB|archive-date=11 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111012615/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16325390|url-status=live}}</ref> Defence Minister [[Oh Jin-wu|Oh Jin Wu]], one of Kim Il Sung's most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim's acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military service. In 1992, Kim Il Sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People's Republic.

In 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the "Dear Father", instead of the "Dear Leader", suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations, exceeded only by those for the 80th [[birthday of Kim Il-sung|birthday of Kim Il Sung]] himself on 15 April that same year.

In 1992, Kim made his first public speech during a military parade for the KPA's 60th anniversary and said:<ref name="Lim2008">{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Kim Jong-il's Leadership of North Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ag16AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155|access-date=21 July 2015|year=2008 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134017126|page=155|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804040908/https://books.google.com/books?id=ag16AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155 |url-status=live}}</ref> "Glory to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army!".<ref name="Jeffries2012">{{cite book|author=Ian Jeffries|title=North Korea, 2009–2012: A Guide to Economic and Political Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVv-IYB2E-QC&pg=PA674|access-date=21 July 2015|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135116989|page=674|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804041105/https://books.google.com/books?id=DVv-IYB2E-QC&pg=PA674 |url-status=live}}</ref> These words were followed by a loud applause by the crowd at Pyongyang's [[Kim Il Sung Square]] where the parade was held.

According to defector [[Hwang Jang-yop|Hwang Jang Yop]], the North Korean government system became even more centralized and [[autocratic]] during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang, although Kim Il Sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast, Kim Jong Il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang, Kim Jong Il personally directed even minor details of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://irp.fas.org/world/rok/nis-docs/hwang2.htm|title=Testimony of Hwang Jang-yop |website=irp.fas.org|access-date=5 May 2022|archive-date=3 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220303125611/https://irp.fas.org/world/rok/nis-docs/hwang2.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 8 July 1994, Kim Il Sung died at the age of 82 from a heart attack.{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=291}} Kim Jong Il had been his father's designated successor as early as 1974,{{sfn|Lim|2015|p=90}} named commander-in-chief in 1991,{{sfn|Becker|2006|p=129}} and became Supreme Leader upon his father's death.<ref name="wilsoncenter 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-rise-kim-jong-il-evidence-east-german-archives\ |title=The Rise of Kim Jong Il – Evidence from East German Archives|publisher=www.wilsoncenter.org|access-date=28 April 2020}}{{Dead link|date=June 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

He officially took over his father's old post as [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea]] on 8 October 1997.{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=175}} In 1998, he was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission, and a constitutional amendment declared that post to be "the highest post of the state."{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=296}} Also in 1998, the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il Sung as the country's "[[Eternal President of the Republic|Eternal President]]" in order to honor his memory forever.{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=274}}

Officially, Kim was part of a [[triumvirate]] heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier [[Choe Yong-rim|Choe Yong Rim]] and parliament chairman [[Kim Yong-nam|Kim Yong Nam]] (no relation). Kim commanded the armed forces, Choe Yong Rim headed the government and handled domestic affairs and Kim Yong Nam handled foreign relations. However, in practice, Kim, like his father before him, exercised absolute control over the government and the country. Although not required to stand for popular election to his key offices, he was unanimously elected to the Supreme People's Assembly every five years, representing a military constituency, due to his concurrent capacities as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the NDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kim-jong-il-personal-secretariat/|title=The Personal Secretariat|date=21 August 2010|publisher=nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com |access-date=19 April 2013|archive-date=23 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423220747/http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kim-jong-il-personal-secretariat/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the wake of the devastation of the 1990s, the government began formally approving some activity of small-scale bartering and trade.

=== Cult of personality ===
{{Main|North Korean cult of personality}}
[[File:DPRK election.jpg|thumb|A North Korean voting booth containing portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il under the national flag (below the portraits is the ballot box)]]

Kim was the focus of an elaborate [[personality cult]] inherited from his father and founder of the DPRK, Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il was often the centre of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country on the occasion of his [[Hwangap]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1823713.stm|title=North Korea marks leader's birthday|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2002|access-date=18 December 2007|archive-date=23 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123095151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1823713.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, the North Korean media reported that Kim's distinctive clothing had set worldwide fashion trends.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nkorea-leader-sets-world-fashion-trend-pyongyang-claims-5533361.html|title=N.Korea leader sets world fashion trend, Pyongyang claims|work=The Independent|date=8 April 2010|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-date=13 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513063138/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nkorea-leader-sets-world-fashion-trend-pyongyang-claims-5533361.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to a 2004 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, the North Korean government under Kim was "among the world's most repressive governments", having up to 200,000 political prisoners according to U.S. and South Korean officials, with no freedom of the press or religion, political opposition or equal education: "Virtually every aspect of political, social, and economic life is controlled by the government."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/08/nkorea9040.htm|title=Human Rights in North Korea|access-date=2 August 2007|date=July 2004|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|archive-date=1 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201160439/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/08/nkorea9040.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Shigemura moreover claimed a voiceprint analysis of Kim speaking in 2004 did not match a known earlier recording. It was also noted that Kim did not appear in public for the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]] in Pyongyang on 28 April 2008. The question had reportedly "baffled foreign [[intelligence agencies]] for years".<ref name="SundayTimes 20080907"/>

On 9 September 2008, various sources reported that after he did not show up that day for a military parade celebrating North Korea's 60th anniversary, United States intelligence agencies believed Kim might be "gravely ill" after having suffered a stroke. He had last been seen in public a month earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/nation/28048604.html |title=North Korea's Kim Jong Il may be gravely ill, jeopardizing progress on halting nukes |author=Pamela Hess and Matthew Lee |work=Star Tribune |date=10 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911223358/http://www.startribune.com/nation/28048604.html |archive-date=11 September 2008 |access-date=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

A former [[CIA]] official said earlier reports of a health crisis were likely accurate. North Korean media remained silent on the issue. An [[Associated Press]] report said analysts believed Kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign ministry, while North Korea's powerful military was against so-called "Six-Party" negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States aimed towards ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons. Some United States officials noted that soon after rumours about Kim's health were publicized a month before, North Korea had taken a "tougher line in nuclear negotiations". In late August North Korea's official news agency reported the government would "consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in [[Nyongbyon]] to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions". Analysts said this meant "the military may have taken the upper hand and that Kim might no longer be wielding absolute authority". By 10 September, there were conflicting reports. Unidentified South Korean government officials said Kim had undergone surgery after suffering a minor stroke and had apparently "intended to attend 9 September event in the afternoon but decided not to because of the aftermath of the surgery". Kim Yong Nam said, "While we wanted to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the country with general secretary Kim Jong Il, we celebrated on our own". Song Il Ho, North Korea's ambassador said, "We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot". Seoul's ''Chosun Ilbo'' newspaper reported that "the South Korean embassy in Beijing had received an intelligence report that Kim collapsed on 22 August".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j2zReXndGtxbEQ9gsY3SWxImKHHw |title=NKorean leader suffered stroke: Seoul intelligence |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=9 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910201948/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j2zReXndGtxbEQ9gsY3SWxImKHHw |archive-date=10 September 2008}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on 9 September that Kim was "very ill and most likely suffered a stroke a few weeks ago, but United States intelligence authorities do not think his death is imminent".<ref>{{Cite web |url-status=dead |url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216142545/http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=8&key=2008091021|title=KBS Global|archivedate=16 December 2008|website=english.kbs.co.kr}}</ref> The [[BBC]] noted that the North Korean government denied these reports, stating that Kim's health problems were "not serious enough to threaten his life",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/09/nkorea.kim|title=Mystery has surrounded Kim Jong Il|publisher=CNN|date=10 September 2008|access-date=7 May 2010|archive-date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801185744/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/09/nkorea.kim/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7607513.stm|title=N Korea insists Kim is not unwell|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 September 2008|access-date=5 January 2010|archive-date=19 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219132754/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7607513.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> although they did confirm that he had suffered a stroke on 15 August.<ref name="time-stroke">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1840419,00.html |title=N Korea: Kim Had Brain Surgery |author=Jae-Soon Chang |magazine=Time |agency=Associated Press |date=11 September 2008 |access-date=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913235534/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1840419%2C00.html |archive-date=13 September 2008}}</ref>

Japan's [[Kyodo News]] agency reported on 14 September, that "Kim collapsed on 14 August due to stroke or a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], and that Beijing dispatched five military doctors at the request of Pyongyang. Kim will require a long period of rest and rehabilitation before he fully recovers and has complete command of his limbs again, as with typical stroke victims".

After Ko's death, Kim lived with [[Kim Ok]], his third mistress, who had served as his personal secretary since the 1980s.

United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman, who was involved in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim, characterised Kim as a reasonable man in negotiations, to the point, but with a sense of humor and personally attentive to the people he was hosting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/interviews/kartman.html|title=Interview: Charles Kartman|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|date=20 February 2003|access-date=14 April 2010|archive-date=30 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330145805/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/interviews/kartman.html|url-status=live}}</ref> However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim's [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=200}}

The field of psychology has long been fascinated with the personality assessment of dictators, a notion that resulted in an extensive personality evaluation of Kim. The report, compiled by Frederick L. Coolidge and Daniel L. Segal (with the assistance of a South Korean psychiatrist considered an expert on Kim's behavior), concluded that the "big six" group of personality disorders shared by dictators [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] ([[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]], [[Paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]]) were also shared by Kim{{spnd}}coinciding primarily with the profile of Saddam Hussein.{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=199}}

The evaluation found that Kim appeared to pride himself on North Korea's independence, despite the extreme hardships it appears to place on the North Korean people{{spnd}}an attribute appearing to emanate from his antisocial personality pattern.{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=200}}

Defectors claimed that Kim had 17 different palaces and residences all over North Korea, including a private resort near [[Baekdu Mountain]], a seaside lodge in the city of [[Wonsan]], and [[Ryongsong Residence]], a palace complex northeast of Pyongyang surrounded with multiple fence lines, [[bunker]]s and anti-aircraft batteries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kim Jong Il, Where He Sleeps and Where He Works |website=[[Daily NK]] |url=https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-jong-il-where-he-sleeps-and-wh/ |date=15 March 2005 |access-date=5 June 2023 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516044422/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk02300&num=83 |archive-date=16 May 2013}}</ref>
