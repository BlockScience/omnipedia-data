16 February 1941 or 1942 -- 17 December 2011) was a North Korean
politician who was the second [supreme leader of North
Korea](Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title) "wikilink"). He led North
Korea from [the
death](Death_and_state_funeral_of_Kim_Il_Sung "wikilink") of his father
[Kim Il Sung](Kim_Il_Sung "wikilink") in 1994 until [his
death](Death_and_state_funeral_of_Kim_Jong_Il "wikilink") in 2011, when
he was succeeded by his son, [Kim Jong Un](Kim_Jong_Un "wikilink").
Afterwards, Kim Jong Il was declared [Eternal General
Secretary](Eternal_leaders_of_North_Korea "wikilink") of the [Workers\'
Party of Korea](Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink") (WPK).

In the early 1980s, Kim had become the [heir
apparent](heir_apparent "wikilink") for the leadership of North Korea,
thus being established the [Kim
dynasty](Kim_family_(North_Korea) "wikilink"), and he assumed important
posts in party and army organs. Kim succeeded his father and founder of
North Korea, Kim Il Sung, following [his
death](Death_and_state_funeral_of_Kim_Il_Sung "wikilink") in 1994. Kim
was the [General Secretary of the
WPK](General_Secretary_of_the_WPK "wikilink"), [WPK
Presidium](Presidium_of_the_Politburo_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink"),
[Chairman](Chairman_of_the_National_Defence_Commission_of_North_Korea "wikilink")
of the [National Defence
Commission](National_Defence_Commission "wikilink") (NDC) of North Korea
and the [Supreme Commander of the Korean People\'s
Army](Supreme_Commander_of_the_Korean_People's_Army "wikilink") (KPA),
the [fourth-largest standing
army](List_of_countries_by_number_of_troops "wikilink") in the world.

Kim ruled North Korea as a
[repressive](Human_rights_in_North_Korea "wikilink") and
[totalitarian](Totalitarianism "wikilink")
dictatorship.`{{efn|Sources saying that Kim ruled North Korea as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Scobell, Andrew.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/66049956|title=Kim Jong Il and North Korea: the leader and the system|date=2006|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|oclc=66049956|access-date=26 June 2020|archive-date=4 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004171736/https://www.worldcat.org/title/kim-jong-il-and-north-korea-the-leader-and-the-system/oclc/66049956/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=McEachern, Patrick|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/747083533|title=Inside the red box : North Korea's post-totalitarian politics|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231153225|oclc=747083533|access-date=26 June 2020|archive-date=4 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004171745/https://www.worldcat.org/title/inside-the-red-box-north-koreas-post-totalitarian-politics/oclc/747083533/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Im, Chae-ch'on|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1100459946|title=Kim Jong Il's leadership of North Korea|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134017119|oclc=1100459946|access-date=26 June 2020|archive-date=4 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004171757/https://www.worldcat.org/title/kim-jong-ils-leadership-of-north-korea/oclc/1100459946/|url-status=live}}</ref>|name=|group=}}`{=mediawiki}
Kim assumed leadership during a period of catastrophic economic crisis
amidst the [dissolution of the Soviet
Union](dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "wikilink"), on which it was
heavily dependent for trade in food and other supplies, which brought [a
famine](North_Korean_famine "wikilink"). While the famine had ended by
the late 1990s, food scarcity continued to be a problem throughout his
tenure. Kim strengthened the role of the
[military](Korean_People's_Army "wikilink") by his
*[Songun](Songun "wikilink")* (\"military-first\") policies, making the
army the central organizer of civil society. Kim\'s rule also saw
tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the [Kaesong
Industrial Park](Kaesong_Industrial_Park "wikilink") in 2003. In April
2009, [North Korea\'s
constitution](North_Korea's_constitution "wikilink") was amended to
refer to him and his successors as the \"supreme leader of the DPRK\".

The most common colloquial [title given to
Kim](List_of_Kim_Jong_Il's_titles "wikilink") during his lifetime was
\"Dear Leader\" to distinguish him from his father Kim Il Sung, the
\"Great Leader\". Following Kim\'s failure to appear at important public
events in 2008, foreign observers assumed that Kim had either fallen
seriously ill or died. On 19 December 2011, the North Korean government
announced that he had died two days earlier, whereupon his third son,
Kim Jong Un, was promoted to a senior position in the ruling WPK and
succeeded him. After his death, alongside \"Eternal General Secretary\"
of the WPK, Kim Jong Il was declared \"Eternal Chairman\" of the now
defunct [National Defence
Commission](National_Defence_Commission "wikilink"), in keeping with
[the tradition of establishing eternal
posts](Eternal_leaders_of_North_Korea "wikilink") for the dead members
of the [Kim dynasty](Kim_family_(North_Korea) "wikilink"). North Korean
media also began referring to Kim as \"the General\" (*Changun*),
similar to his father\'s posthumous designation as \"the \[eternal\]
President\".[^2]

## Early life {#early_life}

### Birth

Soviet records show that Kim Jong Il was born Yuri Kim.[^3][^4][^5] In
literature, it is assumed that he was born in 1941 in either the camp of
[Vyatskoye](Vyatskoye,_Khabarovsk_Krai "wikilink"), near
[Khabarovsk](Khabarovsk "wikilink"),[^6]`{{failed verification|date=July 2024}}`{=mediawiki}
or camp Voroshilov near [Nikolsk](Ussurijsk "wikilink").[^7] According
to Lim Jae Cheon, Kim cannot have been born in Vyatskoye as Kim Il
Sung\'s war records show that he arrived at Vyatskoye only in July 1942
and had been living in Voroshilov before, thus Kim Jong Il is generally
agreed to have been born in Voroshilov.[^8] Kim\'s mother, [Kim Jong
Suk](Kim_Jong-suk "wikilink"), was Kim Il Sung\'s first wife. Inside his
family, he was nicknamed \"Yura\",[^9] while his younger brother [Kim
Man Il](Kim_Man-il "wikilink") (born Aleksandr Kim) was nicknamed
\"Shura\".[^10]

Kim\'s official biography states he was born in a [secret military
camp](Paektusan_Secret_Camp "wikilink") on [Paektu
Mountain](Paektu_Mountain "wikilink")
(`{{Korean|백두산밀영고향집|context=north}}`{=mediawiki}; *Baekdusan
Miryeong Gohyang jip*) in [Chōsen](Chōsen "wikilink") on 16 February
1942.`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|p=1}}`{=mediawiki}
According to one comrade of Kim\'s mother, Lee Min, word of Kim\'s birth
first reached an army camp in Vyatskoye via radio and that both Kim and
his mother did not return there until the following
year.`{{sfn|Breen|2012|p=45}}`{=mediawiki}[^11] Kim Jong Suk died in
1949 from an ectopic pregnancy.[^12]

In 1945, Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea
regained [independence from
Japan](Korea_under_Japanese_rule "wikilink"). His father returned to
[Pyongyang](Pyongyang "wikilink") that September, and in late November
Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at
[Sonbong](Sonbong "wikilink"). The family moved into a former Japanese
officer\'s mansion in Pyongyang, with a garden and pool. Kim\'s brother
drowned there in 1948.[^13]

### Education

According to his official biography, Kim completed the course of general
education between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary
School No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 ([Namsan Higher Middle
School](Namsan_Senior_High_School "wikilink")) in
Pyongyang.[^14]`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|pp=5–6}}`{=mediawiki}
This is contested by foreign academics, who believe he is more likely to
have received his early education in the People\'s Republic of China as
a precaution to ensure his safety during the [Korean
War](Korean_War "wikilink").[^15]`{{Page needed|date=January 2022}}`{=mediawiki}

Throughout his schooling, Kim was involved in politics. He was active in
the Korean Children\'s Union and the Democratic Youth League of North
Korea (DYL), taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and
other literature. In September 1957, he became vice-chairman of his
middle school\'s DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He
pursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage
greater ideological education among his
classmates.`{{sfn|''Kim Jong Il: Brief History''|1998|pp=7–9}}`{=mediawiki}

Kim is also said to have received English language education in
[Malta](Malta "wikilink") in the early 1970s[^16][^17] on his infrequent
holidays there as a guest of Prime Minister [Dom
Mintoff](Dom_Mintoff "wikilink").[^18]

The elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son, [Kim Pyong
Il](Kim_Pyong-il "wikilink"). Since 1988, Kim Pyong Il has served in a
series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean
ambassador to [Poland](Poland "wikilink"). Foreign commentators suspect
that Kim Pyong Il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order
to avoid a power struggle between his two sons.[^19]

## Ascension to power {#ascension_to_power}

### Initial career {#initial_career}

Kim Jong Il officially joined the Workers\' Party of Korea in July
1961.[^20] He rose up the ranks during the 1960s,[^21] and benefited
greatly from the [Kapsan Faction
Incident](Kapsan_Faction_Incident "wikilink") around 1967, which was the
last credible challenge to Kim Il Sung\'s rule.[^22] This incident
marked the first time Kim Jong Il was -- at age 26 -- given official
duties by his father, when the younger Kim took part in the
investigation and purges that followed the incident.[^23]

In addition, Kim Jong Il gave a speech at the plenum; it was his first
as a figure of authority. Kim Jong Il\'s name was also mentioned in
public documents, possibly for the first time, indicating that Kim Il
Sung might have already planned for Jong Il to succeed him as
leader.[^24][^25]

Only six months after, in an unscheduled meeting of the party, Kim Il
Sung called for loyalty in the film industry that had betrayed him with
*An Act of
Sincerity*.`{{efn|''An Act of Sincerity'', described variously as either a film or a stage play, was produced by Kim To-man after the death of Choe Chae-ryon, the wife of Kapsan Faction leader [[Pak Kum-chol]]. It portrayed Choe in a positive light and emphasized her devotion to her husband. Kim Il-sung disapproved of it and implied that it exhibited misplaced loyalty.<ref name="rajongyil">{{cite book|last=Ra|first=Jong-yil|author-mask=Ra Jong-yil|translator=Jinna Park|title=Inside North Korea's Theocracy: The Rise and Sudden Fall of Jang Song-thaek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEyWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35|year=2019|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438473734|access-date=4 August 2022|archive-date=4 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220804174029/https://books.google.com/books?id=yEyWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35|url-status=live}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}
Kim Jong Il himself announced that he was up to the task and thus begun
his influential career in North Korean film-making,[^26] during which he
made significant efforts to further intensify the personality cult of
his father and attach himself to it.[^27]

Kim Jong Il was elected to the [Central
Committee](Central_Committee_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink")
in 1972 and became its secretary the following year.[^28]

However, when Kim Il Sung began to contemplate the succession question
in the early 1970s,[^29] it was not certain that Kim Jong Il would be
his successor.[^30] There was Kim\'s uncle, [Kim Yong
Ju](Kim_Yong_Ju "wikilink"), who was once believed to be Kim Il Sung\'s
eventual successor[^31] but who had made several mistakes in the
struggle for power, had serious flaws,[^32] and was becoming
increasingly marginalized.[^33] Then there was the more serious threat
posed by his stepmother\'s, [Kim Song-ae](Kim_Song-ae "wikilink")\'s,
children, especially by the eldest, [Kim Pyong
Il](Kim_Pyong_Il "wikilink").[^34]

In the end, Kim Jong Il won out: Kim Yong Ju was removed from his top
posts and demoted to vice-premier.[^35] Then Kim Song-ae lost her
position as [chair of the
KDWL](Socialist_Women's_Union_of_Korea "wikilink"), which was her vital
power base.[^36] Kim Pyong Il had many positive characteristics[^37] but
he was also known as a womanizer who threw raucous parties where the
attendees sometimes shouted, \"Long live Kim Pyong Il!\" Kim Jong Il
reported this to his father, knowing that it could be portrayed as a
threat to the personality cult surrounding him. Reportedly, Kim Il Sung
was infuriated and Pyong Il thus fell out of favor, strengthening Kim
Jong Il\'s position.[^38] In 1979, Kim Pyong Il began a series of
diplomatic postings in [Europe](Europe "wikilink"), arranged so as then
he couldn\'t influence politics in North Korea.[^39] Kim Pyong Il only
returned to North Korea in 2019.[^40]

According to Kim Jong Il\'s official biography, the Central Committee
already appointed him successor to Kim Il Sung in 1974. The first public
confirmation of Kim Jong Il\'s position as successor came in 1977, when
in a booklet he was designated as Kim Il Sung\'s only heir.[^41]

### Heir apparent {#heir_apparent}

```{=mediawiki}
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2021}}
```
By the time of the [Sixth Party
Congress](6th_Congress_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink") in
October 1980, Kim\'s control of the Party operation was complete. He was
given senior posts in the
[Presidium](Presidium_of_the_Politburo_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink"),
the [Military
Commission](Central_Military_Commission_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink")
and the party
[Secretariat](Secretariat_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink").
When he was made a member of the [Seventh Supreme People\'s
Assembly](1982_North_Korean_parliamentary_election "wikilink") in
February 1982, international observers deemed him the [heir
apparent](heir_apparent "wikilink") of North Korea. Prior to 1980, he
had no public profile and was referred to only as the \"Party
Centre\".`{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=127}}`{=mediawiki} At this time Kim assumed
the title \"Dear Leader\"
(`{{korean|hangul=친애하는 지도자|mr=ch'inaehanŭn jidoja|context=north}}`{=mediawiki}),[^42]
and the government began building a [personality
cult](personality_cult "wikilink") around him patterned after that of
his father, the \"Great Leader\". Kim was regularly hailed by the media
as the \"fearless leader\" and \"the great successor to the
revolutionary cause\". He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his
father in North Korea.

By the 1980s, North Korea began to experience severe economic
stagnation. Kim Il Sung\'s policy of *[Juche](Juche "wikilink")*
(self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade, even
with its traditional partners, the Soviet Union and China. South Korea
accused Kim of ordering the [1983 bombing in
Rangoon](Rangoon_bombing "wikilink"), Burma which killed 17 visiting
South Korean officials, including four cabinet members, and another in
1987 which killed all 115 onboard [Korean Air Flight
858](Korean_Air_Flight_858 "wikilink").[^43] A North Korean agent, [Kim
Hyon Hui](Kim_Hyon-hui "wikilink"), confessed to planting a bomb in the
case of the second, saying the operation was ordered by Kim
personally.[^44]

On 24 December 1991, Kim was also named [Supreme Commander of the Korean
People\'s
Army](Supreme_Commander_of_the_Korean_People's_Army "wikilink").[^45]
Defence Minister [Oh Jin Wu](Oh_Jin-wu "wikilink"), one of Kim Il
Sung\'s most loyal subordinates, engineered Kim\'s acceptance by the
Army as the next leader of North Korea, despite his lack of military
service. In 1992, Kim Il Sung publicly stated that his son was in charge
of all internal affairs in the Democratic People\'s Republic.

In 1992, radio broadcasts started referring to him as the \"Dear
Father\", instead of the \"Dear Leader\", suggesting a promotion. His
50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations,
exceeded only by those for the 80th [birthday of Kim Il
Sung](birthday_of_Kim_Il-sung "wikilink") himself on 15 April that same
year.

In 1992, Kim made his first public speech during a military parade for
the KPA\'s 60th anniversary and said:[^46] \"Glory to the officers and
soldiers of the heroic Korean People\'s Army!\".[^47] These words were
followed by a loud applause by the crowd at Pyongyang\'s [Kim Il Sung
Square](Kim_Il_Sung_Square "wikilink") where the parade was held.

Kim was named
[Chairman](Chairman_of_the_National_Defence_Commission_of_North_Korea "wikilink")
of the [National Defence
Commission](National_Defence_Commission_of_North_Korea "wikilink") on 9
April 1993, making him day-to-day commander of the armed forces.[^48]

According to defector [Hwang Jang Yop](Hwang_Jang-yop "wikilink"), the
North Korean government system became even more centralized and
[autocratic](autocratic "wikilink") during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim
than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang,
although Kim Il Sung required his ministers to be loyal to him, he
nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making.
In contrast, Kim Jong Il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from
his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise, and he
viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty.
According to Hwang, Kim Jong Il personally directed even minor details
of state affairs, such as the size of houses for party secretaries and

## Leader of North Korea {#leader_of_north_korea}

![North Koreans bowing to the statues of Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim
Il Sung, at the [Mansu Hill Grand
Monument](Mansu_Hill_Grand_Monument "wikilink")](The_statues_of_Kim_Il_Sung_and_Kim_Jong_Il_on_Mansu_Hill_in_Pyongyang_(april_2012).jpg "North Koreans bowing to the statues of Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Il Sung, at the Mansu Hill Grand Monument")

On 8 July 1994, Kim Il Sung died at the age of 82 from a heart
attack.`{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=291}}`{=mediawiki} Kim Jong Il had been his
father\'s designated successor as early as
1974,`{{sfn|Lim|2015|p=90}}`{=mediawiki} named commander-in-chief in
1991,`{{sfn|Becker|2006|p=129}}`{=mediawiki} and became Supreme Leader
upon his father\'s death.[^50]

He officially took over his father\'s old post as [General Secretary of
the Workers\' Party of
Korea](General_Secretary_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea "wikilink") on 8
October 1997.`{{sfn|Buzo|2002|p=175}}`{=mediawiki} In 1998, he was
re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission, and a
constitutional amendment declared that post to be \"the highest post of
the state.\"`{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=296}}`{=mediawiki} Also in 1998, the
[Supreme People\'s Assembly](Supreme_People's_Assembly "wikilink") wrote
the president\'s post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il Sung
as the country\'s \"[Eternal
President](Eternal_President_of_the_Republic "wikilink")\" in order to
honor his memory forever.`{{sfn|Kleiner|2001|p=274}}`{=mediawiki}

Officially, Kim was part of a [triumvirate](triumvirate "wikilink")
heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with
Premier [Choe Yong Rim](Choe_Yong-rim "wikilink") and parliament
chairman [Kim Yong Nam](Kim_Yong-nam "wikilink") (no relation). Kim
commanded the armed forces, Choe Yong Rim headed the government and
handled domestic affairs and Kim Yong Nam handled foreign relations.
However, in practice, Kim, like his father before him, exercised
absolute control over the government and the country. Although not
required to stand for popular election to his key offices, he was
unanimously elected to the Supreme People\'s Assembly every five years,
representing a military constituency, due to his concurrent capacities
as supreme commander of the KPA and chairman of the NDC.[^51]

### Economic policies {#economic_policies}

Kim had a \"reputation for being almost comically incompetent in matters
of economic
management\".`{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA130 130]}}`{=mediawiki}
The [economy of North Korea](economy_of_North_Korea "wikilink")
struggled throughout the 1990s, primarily due to mismanagement. In
addition, North Korea experienced severe [floods](floods "wikilink") in
the mid-1990s, exacerbated by poor land
management.`{{sfn|Noland|2004}}`{=mediawiki}[^52][^53] This, compounded
with the fact that only 18% of North Korea is arable land[^54] and the
country\'s inability to import the goods necessary to sustain
industry,[^55] led to a [severe
famine](Famine_in_North_Korea "wikilink") and left North Korea
economically devastated. Faced with a country in decay, Kim adopted a
[\"Military-First\" policy](Songun "wikilink") to strengthen the country
and reinforce the regime.[^56] On the national scale, the [Japanese
Foreign Ministry](Japanese_Foreign_Ministry "wikilink") acknowledges
that this has resulted in a positive growth rate for the country since
1996, with the implementation of \"landmark socialist-type market
economic practices\" in 2002, keeping the North afloat despite a
continued dependency on foreign aid for food.[^57]

In the wake of the devastation of the 1990s, the government began
formally approving some activity of small-scale bartering and trade. As
observed by Daniel Sneider, associate director for research at the
Stanford University [Asia--Pacific Research
Center](Asia–Pacific_Research_Center "wikilink"), this flirtation with
capitalism was \"fairly limited, but`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}especially
compared to the past`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}there are now remarkable
markets that create the semblance of a [free
market](free_market "wikilink") system\".[^58]

In 2002, Kim declared that \"money should be capable of measuring the
worth of all commodities.\"[^59] These gestures toward economic reform
mirror similar actions taken by China\'s [Deng
Xiaoping](Deng_Xiaoping "wikilink") in the late 1980s and early 90s.
During a rare visit in 2006, Kim expressed admiration for China\'s rapid
economic progress.[^60]

An unsuccessful devaluation of the [North Korean
won](North_Korean_won "wikilink") in 2009, initiated or approved by Kim
personally,`{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA130 130]}}`{=mediawiki}
caused brief economic chaos and uncovered the vulnerability of the
country\'s societal fabric in the face of
crisis.`{{sfn|Lankov|2014|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA131 131]–[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133 133]}}`{=mediawiki}

### Foreign relations {#foreign_relations}

![Kim talking with Russian President [Vladimir
Putin](Vladimir_Putin "wikilink") during their 2001 meeting in
Moscow](Vladimir_Putin_4_August_2001-1.jpg "Kim talking with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 2001 meeting in Moscow")
Kim was known as a skilled and manipulative
diplomat.`{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA130 130]}}`{=mediawiki}
In 1998, South Korean President [Kim Dae-jung](Kim_Dae-jung "wikilink")
implemented the \"[Sunshine Policy](Sunshine_Policy "wikilink")\" to
improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to
start projects in the North. Kim announced plans to import and develop
new technologies to develop North Korea\'s fledgling software industry.
As a result of the new policy, the [Kaesong Industrial
Park](Kaesong_Industrial_Park "wikilink") was constructed in 2003 just
north of the [demilitarized
zone](Korean_Demilitarized_Zone "wikilink").[^61]

![[Kim Ok](Kim_Ok "wikilink"), Kim\'s personal secretary, with U.S.
Secretary of Defense [William Cohen](William_Cohen "wikilink"),
2000](SD_William_Cohen_meets_with_Jo_Myong_Rok_in_the_Pentagon.jpg "Kim Ok, Kim's personal secretary, with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, 2000")
In 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an [Agreed
Framework](Agreed_Framework "wikilink") which was designed to freeze and
eventually dismantle the North\'s [nuclear weapons
program](North_Korean_nuclear_weapons_program "wikilink") in exchange
for aid in producing two power-generating [nuclear
reactors](nuclear_reactor "wikilink") and the assurance that it would
not be invaded again. In 2000, after a meeting with [Madeleine
Albright](Madeleine_Albright "wikilink"), he agreed to a moratorium on
missile construction.[^62][^63] In 2002, Kim\'s government admitted to
having produced nuclear weapons since the 1994 agreement. Kim\'s regime
argued the secret production was necessary for security
purposes`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}citing the presence of United States-owned
nuclear weapons in South Korea and the new tensions with the United
States under President [George W. Bush](George_W._Bush "wikilink").[^64]
On 9 October 2006, North Korea\'s Korean Central News Agency announced
that it had successfully conducted [an underground nuclear
test](2006_North_Korean_nuclear_test "wikilink").[^65]

### Cult of personality {#cult_of_personality}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|North Korean cult of personality}}
```
![A North Korean voting booth containing portraits of Kim Il Sung and
Kim Jong Il under the national flag (below the portraits is the ballot
box)](DPRK_election.jpg "A North Korean voting booth containing portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il under the national flag (below the portraits is the ballot box)")

Kim was the focus of an elaborate [personality
cult](personality_cult "wikilink") inherited from his father and founder
of the DPRK, Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il was often the centre of attention
throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. On his 60th birthday (based on his
official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the
country on the occasion of his [Hwangap](Hwangap "wikilink").[^66] In
2010, the North Korean media reported that Kim\'s distinctive clothing
had set worldwide fashion trends.[^67]

The prevailing point of view is that the people\'s adherence to Kim\'s
cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il Sung or out of
fear of punishment for failure to pay homage.[^68] Media and government
sources from outside North Korea generally support this
view,[^69][^70][^71][^72][^73] while North Korean government sources
aver that it was genuine hero worship.[^74] The song \"[No Motherland
Without You](No_Motherland_Without_You "wikilink")\", sung by the [KPA
State Merited
Choir](Korean_People's_Army_State_Merited_Chorus_and_Symphony_Orchestra "wikilink"),
was created especially for Kim in 1992 and is frequently broadcast on
the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.[^75]

### Human rights record {#human_rights_record}

```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|Human rights in North Korea}}
```
According to a 2004 [Human Rights Watch](Human_Rights_Watch "wikilink")
report, the North Korean government under Kim was \"among the world\'s
most repressive governments\", having up to 200,000 political prisoners
according to U.S. and South Korean officials, with no freedom of the
press or religion, political opposition or equal education: \"Virtually
every aspect of political, social, and economic life is controlled by
the government.\"[^76]

Kim\'s government was accused of \"[crimes against
humanity](crimes_against_humanity "wikilink")\" for its alleged
culpability in creating and prolonging the [1990s
famine](North_Korean_famine "wikilink").`{{sfn|Noland|2004}}`{=mediawiki}[^77][^78]
Human Rights Watch characterized him as a
[dictator](dictator "wikilink") and accused him of [human rights
violations](human_rights_violations "wikilink").[^79] [Amnesty
International](Amnesty_International "wikilink") condemned him for
leaving \'millions of North Koreans mired in poverty\' and detaining
hundreds of thousands of people in prison camps.[^80]

Kim Jong Il claimed that the barometer for distinguishing whether a
person can be deemed a member of North Korean society and hence entitled
to rights \'lies not on the grounds of his social class but on the
grounds of his ideology\'.[^81]

## Health and rumours of waning power {#health_and_rumours_of_waning_power}

### 2008 reports

In an August 2008 issue of the Japanese newsweekly *[Shūkan
Gendai](Shūkan_Gendai "wikilink")*, [Waseda
University](Waseda_University "wikilink") professor Toshimitsu
Shigemura, an authority on the [Korean
Peninsula](Korean_Peninsula "wikilink"),[^82] claimed that Kim died of
[diabetes](diabetes "wikilink") in late 2003 and had been replaced in
public appearances by one or more stand-ins previously employed to
protect him from assassination attempts.[^83] In a subsequent
best-selling book, *The True Character of Kim Jong Il*, Shigemura cited
apparently unnamed people close to Kim\'s family along with Japanese and
South Korean intelligence sources, claiming they confirmed Kim\'s
diabetes took a turn for the worse early in 2000 and from then until his
supposed death three-and-a-half years later he was using a wheelchair.
Shigemura moreover claimed a voiceprint analysis of Kim speaking in 2004
did not match a known earlier recording. It was also noted that Kim did
not appear in public for the [Olympic torch
relay](2008_Summer_Olympics_torch_relay "wikilink") in Pyongyang on 28
April 2008. The question had reportedly \"baffled foreign [intelligence
agencies](intelligence_agencies "wikilink") for years\".[^84]

On 9 September 2008, various sources reported that after he did not show
up that day for a military parade celebrating North Korea\'s 60th
anniversary, United States intelligence agencies believed Kim might be
\"gravely ill\" after having suffered a stroke. He had last been seen in
public a month earlier.[^85]

A former [CIA](CIA "wikilink") official said earlier reports of a health
crisis were likely accurate. North Korean media remained silent on the
issue. An [Associated Press](Associated_Press "wikilink") report said
analysts believed Kim had been supporting moderates in the foreign
ministry, while North Korea\'s powerful military was against so-called
\"Six-Party\" negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and
the United States aimed towards ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons.
Some United States officials noted that soon after rumours about Kim\'s
health were publicized a month before, North Korea had taken a \"tougher
line in nuclear negotiations\". In late August North Korea\'s official
news agency reported the government would \"consider soon a step to
restore the nuclear facilities in [Nyongbyon](Nyongbyon "wikilink") to
their original state as strongly requested by its relevant
institutions\". Analysts said this meant \"the military may have taken
the upper hand and that Kim might no longer be wielding absolute
authority\". By 10 September, there were conflicting reports.
Unidentified South Korean government officials said Kim had undergone
surgery after suffering a minor stroke and had apparently \"intended to
attend 9 September event in the afternoon but decided not to because of
the aftermath of the surgery\". Kim Yong Nam said, \"While we wanted to
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the country with general secretary Kim
Jong Il, we celebrated on our own\". Song Il Ho, North Korea\'s
ambassador said, \"We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather
as a conspiracy plot\". Seoul\'s *Chosun Ilbo* newspaper reported that
\"the South Korean embassy in Beijing had received an intelligence
report that Kim collapsed on 22 August\".[^86] *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* reported on 9 September that Kim
was \"very ill and most likely suffered a stroke a few weeks ago, but
United States intelligence authorities do not think his death is
imminent\".[^87] The [BBC](BBC "wikilink") noted that the North Korean
government denied these reports, stating that Kim\'s health problems
were \"not serious enough to threaten his life\",[^88][^89] although
they did confirm that he had suffered a stroke on 15 August.[^90]

![Kim at a meeting during his visit with [Dmitry
Medvedev](Dmitry_Medvedev "wikilink") in August
2011](Kim_Jong-il_2011-5.jpg "Kim at a meeting during his visit with Dmitry Medvedev in August 2011")
Japan\'s [Kyodo News](Kyodo_News "wikilink") agency reported on 14
September, that \"Kim collapsed on 14 August due to stroke or a
[cerebral hemorrhage](cerebral_hemorrhage "wikilink"), and that Beijing
dispatched five military doctors at the request of Pyongyang. Kim will
require a long period of rest and rehabilitation before he fully
recovers and has complete command of his limbs again, as with typical
stroke victims\". Japan\'s *[Mainichi
Shimbun](Mainichi_Shimbun "wikilink")* claimed Kim had occasionally lost
consciousness since April.[^91] Japan\'s *[Tokyo
Shimbun](Tokyo_Shimbun "wikilink")* on 15 September, added that Kim was
staying at the Bongwha State Guest House. He was apparently conscious
\"but he needs some time to recuperate from the recent stroke, with some
parts of his hands and feet paralyzed\". It cited Chinese sources which
claimed that one cause for the stroke could have been stress brought
about by the United States delay to remove North Korea from its list of
state sponsors of terrorism.[^92]

On 19 October, North Korea reportedly ordered its diplomats to stay near
their embassies to await \"an important message\", according to Japan\'s
*[Yomiuri Shimbun](Yomiuri_Shimbun "wikilink")*, setting off renewed
speculation about the health of the ailing leader.[^93]

By 29 October 2008, reports stated Kim suffered a serious setback and
had been taken back to the hospital.[^94] *The New York Times* reported
that Japanese Prime Minister [Taro Aso](Taro_Aso "wikilink"), on 28
October 2008, stated in a [parliamentary
session](parliamentary_session "wikilink") that Kim had been
hospitalized: \"His condition is not so good. However, I don\'t think he
is totally incapable of making decisions\". Aso further said a French
[neurosurgeon](neurosurgeon "wikilink") was aboard a plane for Beijing,
en route to North Korea. Further, Kim Sung-ho, director of South
Korea\'s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a closed
parliamentary session in [Seoul](Seoul "wikilink") that \"Kim appeared
to be recovering quickly enough to start performing his daily
duties\".[^95] *[The Dong-a Ilbo](The_Dong-a_Ilbo "wikilink")* newspaper
reported \"a serious problem\" with Kim\'s health. Japan\'s [Fuji
Television](Fuji_Television "wikilink") network reported that Kim\'s
eldest son, [Kim Jong Nam](Kim_Jong-nam "wikilink"), traveled to Paris
to hire a neurosurgeon for his father, and showed footage where the
surgeon boarded flight CA121 bound for Pyongyang from Beijing on 24
October. The French weekly *[Le Point](Le_Point "wikilink")* identified
him as Francois-Xavier Roux, [neurosurgery](neurosurgery "wikilink")
director of Paris\' Sainte-Anne Hospital, but Roux himself stated he was
in Beijing for several days and not North Korea.[^96] On 19 December
2011, Roux confirmed that Kim suffered a debilitating stroke in 2008 and
was treated by himself and other French doctors at Pyongyang\'s Red
Cross Hospital. Roux said Kim suffered few lasting effects.[^97]

On 5 November 2008, the North\'s Korean Central News Agency published 2
photos showing Kim posing with dozens of [Korean People\'s
Army](Korean_People's_Army "wikilink") (KPA) soldiers on a visit to
military Unit 2200 and sub-unit of Unit 534. Shown with his usual
[bouffant](bouffant "wikilink") hairstyle, with his trademark sunglasses
and a white winter parka, Kim stood in front of trees with autumn
foliage and a red-and-white banner.[^98][^99][^100][^101] *[The
Times](The_Times "wikilink")* questioned the authenticity of at least
one of these photos.[^102]

In November 2008, Japan\'s [TBS TV
network](Tokyo_Broadcasting_System "wikilink") reported that Kim had
suffered a second stroke in October, which \"affected the movement of
his left arm and leg and also his ability to speak\".[^103] However,
South Korea\'s intelligence agency rejected this report.[^104]

In response to the rumors regarding Kim\'s health and supposed loss of
power, in April 2009, North Korea released a video showing Kim visiting
factories and other places around the country between November and
December 2008.[^105] In 2010, [leaked diplomatic
cables](United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak "wikilink") purportedly
attested that Kim suffered from [epilepsy](epilepsy "wikilink").[^106]

According to *[The Daily Telegraph](The_Daily_Telegraph "wikilink")*,
Kim was a [chain-smoker](Chain_smoking "wikilink").[^107]

![Portraits of Kim Jong Il and his father in the [Grand People\'s Study
House](Grand_People's_Study_House "wikilink") in
Pyongyang](Grand_People's_Study_House_08.JPG "Portraits of Kim Jong Il and his father in the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang")

### Successor

Kim\'s three sons and his brother-in-law, along with [O Kuk
Ryol](O_Kuk-ryol "wikilink"), an army general, had been noted as
possible successors, but the North Korean government had for a time been
wholly silent on this matter.[^108]

Kim Yong Hyun, a political expert at the Institute for North Korean
Studies at Seoul\'s [Dongguk University](Dongguk_University "wikilink"),
said in 2007: \"Even the North Korean establishment would not advocate a
continuation of the family [dynasty](dynasty "wikilink") at this
point\".[^109] Kim\'s eldest son Kim Jong-Nnam was earlier believed to
be the designated heir but he appeared to have fallen out of favor after
being arrested at [Narita International
Airport](Narita_International_Airport "wikilink") near Tokyo in 2001
where he was caught attempting to enter Japan on a [fake
passport](fake_passport "wikilink") to visit [Tokyo
Disneyland](Tokyo_Disneyland "wikilink").[^110]

On 2 June 2009, it was reported that Kim\'s youngest son, Kim Jong Un,
was to be North Korea\'s next leader.[^111] Like his father and
grandfather, he has also been given an official
[sobriquet](sobriquet "wikilink"), The Brilliant Comrade.[^112] Prior to
his death, it had been reported that Kim was expected to officially
designate the son as his successor in
2012.`{{sfn|Lankov|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144 144]}}`{=mediawiki}

### Re-election as leader {#re_election_as_leader}

On 9 April 2009, Kim was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence
Commission[^113] and made an appearance at the Supreme People\'s
Assembly. This was the first time Kim was seen in public since August
2008. He was unanimously re-elected and given a standing ovation.[^114]

On 28 September 2010, Kim was re-elected as General Secretary of the
Workers\' Party of Korea.[^115]

### 2010 and 2011 foreign visits {#and_2011_foreign_visits}

![Kim with [Russian President](Russian_President "wikilink") Dmitry

Kim reportedly visited the People\'s Republic of China in May 2010. He
entered the country via his [personal
train](North_Korean_leaders'_trains "wikilink") on 3 May and stayed in a
hotel in [Dalian](Dalian "wikilink").[^116] In May 2010, Assistant U.S.
Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs [Kurt
Campbell](Kurt_M._Campbell "wikilink") told South Korean officials that
Kim had only three years to live, according to medical information that
had been compiled.[^117] Kim travelled to China again in August 2010,
this time with his son, fueling speculation at the time that he was
ready to hand over power to his son, [Kim Jong
Un](Kim_Jong_Un "wikilink").[^118]

He returned to China again in May 2011, marking the 50th anniversary of
the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual
Assistance between China and the DPRK.[^119] In late August 2011, he
traveled by train to the Russian Far East to meet with President Dmitry
Medvedev for unspecified talks.[^120]

### Late 2011 {#late_2011}

There were speculations that the visits of Kim abroad in 2010 and 2011
were a sign of his improving health and a possible slowdown in
succession might follow. After the visit to Russia, Kim appeared in a
military parade in Pyongyang on 9 September, accompanied by Kim Jong
Un.[^121]

## Death

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Death and state funeral of Kim Jong Il}}
```
![An official portrait of Kim, issued after his
death](Kim_Jong_il_Portrait.jpg "An official portrait of Kim, issued after his death")
It was reported that Kim had died of a suspected [heart
attack](heart_attack "wikilink") on 17 December 2011 at
8:30`{{nbsp}}`{=mediawiki}am while [travelling by
train](North_Korean_leaders'_trains "wikilink") to an area outside
Pyongyang.[^122][^123] He was succeeded by his youngest son Kim Jong Un,
who was hailed by the Korean Central News Agency as the \"Great
Successor\".[^124][^125][^126] According to the Korean Central News
Agency (KCNA), during his death a fierce snowstorm \"paused\" and \"the
sky glowed red above the sacred [Mount
Paektu](Mount_Paektu "wikilink")\" and the ice on a famous lake also
cracked so loud that it seemed to \"shake the Heavens and the
Earth\".[^127]

Kim\'s funeral took place on 28 December in Pyongyang, with a mourning
period lasting until the following day. South Korea\'s military was
immediately put on alert after the announcement and its National
Security Council convened for an emergency meeting, out of concern that
political jockeying in North Korea could destabilise the region. Asian
stock markets fell soon after the announcement, due to similar
concerns.[^128]

On 12 January 2012, North Korea called Kim the \"eternal leader\" and
announced that his body would be preserved and displayed at Pyongyang\'s
[Kumsusan Memorial Palace](Kumsusan_Memorial_Palace "wikilink").
Officials also announced plans to install statues, portraits, and
\"towers to his immortality\" across the country.[^129][^130] His
birthday of 16 February was declared \"the greatest auspicious holiday
of the nation\" and was named the Day of the Shining Star.[^131]

In February 2012, on what would have been his 71st birthday, Kim was
posthumously made [Dae Wonsu](Dae_Wonsu "wikilink") (usually translated
as *[Generalissimo](Generalissimo "wikilink")*, literally [Grand
Marshal](Grand_Marshal "wikilink")), the nation\'s top military rank. He
had been named [Wonsu](Wonsu_(North_Korea) "wikilink") (Marshal) in 1992
when North Korean founder Kim Il Sung was promoted to Dae Wonsu.[^132]
Also in February 2012, the North Korean government created the [Order of
Kim Jong Il](Order_of_Kim_Jong_Il "wikilink") in his honor and awarded
it to 132 individuals for services in building a \"thriving socialist
nation\" and for increasing defense capabilities.[^133]

## Personal life {#personal_life}

### Family

```{=mediawiki}
{{Further|Kim family (North Korea)}}
```
![Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il
Sung](Kimilsungia_and_Kimjongilia.JPG "Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung")
There is no official information available about Kim Jong Il\'s marital
history, but he is believed to have been officially married twice and to
have had three [mistresses](mistress_(lover) "wikilink").[^134] He had
three known sons: [Kim Jong Nam](Kim_Jong-nam "wikilink"), [Kim Jong
Chul](Kim_Jong-chul "wikilink") and Kim Jong Un. His two known daughters
are [Kim Sol Song](Kim_Sol-song "wikilink") and [Kim Yo
Jong](Kim_Yo_Jong "wikilink").[^135][^136]

Kim\'s first wife, [Hong Il Chon](Hong_Il-chon "wikilink"), was the
daughter of a [martyr](martyr "wikilink") who died during the Korean
War. She was handpicked by his father and married to him in 1966. They
had a daughter called Kim Hye
Kyung,`{{sfn|Breen|2012|p=64}}`{=mediawiki} who was born in 1968. Soon
afterwards, they divorced in 1969.

Kim\'s first mistress, [Song Hye Rim](Song_Hye-rim "wikilink"), was a
star of North Korean films. She was already married to another man and
with a child when they met.[^137] Kim is reported to have forced her
husband to divorce her. This relationship, which started in 1970, was
not officially recognized. They had one son, Kim Jong Nam (1971--2017),
who was Kim Jong Il\'s eldest son. Kim kept both the relationship and
the child a secret (even from his father) until he ascended to power in
1994.[^138][^139] However, after years of estrangement, Song is believed
to have died in Moscow in the [Central Clinical
Hospital](Central_Clinical_Hospital "wikilink") in 2002.[^140]

Kim\'s official wife, [Kim Young Sook](Kim_Young-sook "wikilink"), was
the daughter of a high-ranking military official. His father Kim Il Sung
handpicked her to marry his son.[^141] The two were estranged for some
years before Kim\'s death. Kim had a daughter from this marriage, Kim
Sol Song (born 1974).[^142]

His second mistress, [Ko Yong Hui](Ko_Yong-hui "wikilink"), was a
Japanese-born ethnic Korean and a dancer. She had taken over the role of
[First Lady](First_Lady "wikilink") until her
death`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}reportedly of cancer`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}in
2004. They had two sons, Kim Jong Chul (in 1981) and Kim Jong Un, also
\"Jong Woon\" or \"Jong Woong\" (in 1983).[^143][^144] They also had a
daughter, Kim Yo Jong, who was about 23 years old in 2012.[^145][^146]

After Ko\'s death, Kim lived with [Kim Ok](Kim_Ok "wikilink"), his third
mistress, who had served as his personal secretary since the 1980s. She
\"virtually act\[ed\] as North Korea\'s first lady\" and frequently
accompanied Kim on his visits to military bases and in meetings with
visiting foreign dignitaries. She traveled with Kim on a secretive trip
to China in January 2006, where she was received by Chinese officials as
Kim\'s wife.[^147]

According to Michael Breen, author of the book *Kim Jong Il: North
Korea\'s Dear Leader*, the women intimately linked to Kim never acquired
any power or influence of consequence. As he explains, their roles were
limited to that of romance and domesticity.[^148]

He had a younger sister, [Kim Kyong Hui](Kim_Kyong-hui "wikilink"). She
was married to [Jang Sung Taek](Jang_Sung-taek "wikilink"), who was
executed in December 2013 in [Pyongyang](Pyongyang "wikilink"), after
being charged with treason and corruption.[^149]

### Personality

![Kim in 2000](Kim_Jong-Il.jpg "Kim in 2000") Like his father, Kim had a
[fear of flying](fear_of_flying "wikilink")[^150] and always travelled
by [private armored train](North_Korean_leaders'_trains "wikilink") for
state visits to Russia and China.[^151] The [BBC](BBC "wikilink")
reported that [Konstantin Pulikovsky](Konstantin_Pulikovsky "wikilink"),
a Russian emissary who travelled with Kim across Russia by train, told
reporters that Kim had live [lobsters](lobster "wikilink") air-lifted to
the train every day and ate them with silver chopsticks.[^152]

Kim was said to be a huge film fan, owning a collection of more than
20,000 [video tapes](video_tape "wikilink") and
[DVDs](DVD "wikilink").[^153][^154] His reported favourite movie
franchises included *[James Bond](James_Bond "wikilink")*, *[Friday the
13th](Friday_the_13th_(franchise) "wikilink")*,
*[Rambo](Rambo_(film_series) "wikilink")*,
*[Godzilla](Godzilla_(series) "wikilink")*, *[Otoko wa Tsurai
yo](Otoko_wa_Tsurai_yo "wikilink")* and [Hong Kong action
cinema](Hong_Kong_action_cinema "wikilink"),[^155][^156] with [Sean
Connery](Sean_Connery "wikilink") and [Elizabeth
Taylor](Elizabeth_Taylor "wikilink") his favourite male and female
actors.[^157][^158] Kim was also said to have been a fan of [Ealing
comedies](Ealing_comedies "wikilink"), inspired by their emphasis on
team spirit and a mobilised proletariat.[^159] Kim oversaw the
production of *[The Flower Girl](The_Flower_Girl "wikilink")*, a film
which also became immensely popular in China.[^160] He authored *[On the
Art of the Cinema](On_the_Art_of_the_Cinema "wikilink")*. In 1978, on
Kim\'s orders South Korean film director [Shin
Sang-ok](Shin_Sang-ok "wikilink") and his actress wife [Choi
Eun-hee](Choi_Eun-hee "wikilink") [were
kidnapped](Abduction_of_Shin_Sang-ok_and_Choi_Eun-hee "wikilink") in
order to build a North Korean film industry.[^161] In 2006, he was
involved in the production of the [Juche](Juche "wikilink")-based movie
*[The Schoolgirl\'s Diary](The_Schoolgirl's_Diary "wikilink")*, which
depicted the life of a young girl whose parents are scientists, with a
[KCNA](Korean_Central_News_Agency "wikilink") news report stating that
Kim \"improved its script and guided its production\".[^162]

Although Kim enjoyed many foreign forms of entertainment, according to
former [bodyguard](Supreme_Guard_Command "wikilink") [Lee Young
Kuk](Yodok_concentration_camp#Prisoners_(witnesses) "wikilink"), he
refused to consume any food or drink not produced in North Korea, with
the exception of wine from France.[^163] His former chef [Kenji
Fujimoto](Kenji_Fujimoto "wikilink"), however, has stated that Kim
sometimes sent him around the world to purchase a variety of foreign
[delicacies](delicacy "wikilink").[^164]

Kim reportedly enjoyed basketball. Former [United States Secretary of
State](United_States_Secretary_of_State "wikilink") [Madeleine
Albright](Madeleine_Albright "wikilink") ended her summit with Kim by
presenting him with a basketball signed by
[NBA](National_Basketball_Association "wikilink") legend [Michael
Jordan](Michael_Jordan "wikilink").[^165] His official biography also
claims that Kim composed six operas and enjoyed staging elaborate
[musicals](musical_theater "wikilink").[^166]

![Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il
Sung](Laika_ac_Samijyon_(6900265643).jpg "Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung")
United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman,
who was involved in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim,
characterised Kim as a reasonable man in negotiations, to the point, but
with a sense of humor and personally attentive to the people he was
hosting.[^167] However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim\'s
[antisocial](antisocial_personality_disorder "wikilink") features, such
as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to
make negotiations extraordinarily
difficult.`{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=200}}`{=mediawiki}

The field of psychology has long been fascinated with the personality
assessment of dictators, a notion that resulted in an extensive
personality evaluation of Kim. The report, compiled by Frederick L.
Coolidge and Daniel L. Segal (with the assistance of a South Korean
psychiatrist considered an expert on Kim\'s behavior), concluded that
the \"big six\" group of personality disorders shared by dictators
[Adolf Hitler](Adolf_Hitler "wikilink"), [Joseph
Stalin](Joseph_Stalin "wikilink") and [Saddam
Hussein](Saddam_Hussein "wikilink")
([sadistic](Sadistic_personality_disorder "wikilink"),
[paranoid](Paranoid_personality_disorder "wikilink"),
[antisocial](Antisocial_personality_disorder "wikilink"),
[narcissistic](Narcissistic_personality_disorder "wikilink"),
[schizoid](Schizoid_personality_disorder "wikilink") and
[schizotypal](Schizotypal_personality_disorder "wikilink")) were also
shared by Kim`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}coinciding primarily with the profile
of Saddam Hussein.`{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=199}}`{=mediawiki}

The evaluation found that Kim appeared to pride himself on North
Korea\'s independence, despite the extreme hardships it appears to place
on the North Korean people`{{spnd}}`{=mediawiki}an attribute appearing
to emanate from his antisocial personality
pattern.`{{sfn|Coolidge|Segal|2009|p=200}}`{=mediawiki}

Defectors claimed that Kim had 17 different palaces and residences all
over North Korea, including a private resort near [Baekdu
Mountain](Baekdu_Mountain "wikilink"), a seaside lodge in the city of
[Wonsan](Wonsan "wikilink"), and [Ryongsong
Residence](Ryongsong_Residence "wikilink"), a palace complex northeast
of Pyongyang surrounded with multiple fence lines,
[bunkers](bunker "wikilink") and anti-aircraft batteries.[^168]

### Finances

According to a 2010 report in the *[Sunday
Telegraph](Sunday_Telegraph "wikilink")*, Kim had
4`{{nbsp}}`{=mediawiki}billion [USD](United_States_dollar "wikilink") on
deposit in European banks in case he ever needed to flee North Korea.
The *Sunday Telegraph* reported that most of the money was in banks in
[Luxembourg](Luxembourg "wikilink").[^169]
