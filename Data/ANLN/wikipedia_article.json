In humans and ''Drosophila'', anillins are recruited to the equatorial cortex in a RhoA-dependent manner. This recruitment is independent of other cytoskeletal Rho targets such as myosin, F-actin, and Rho-kinase. It has been observed that anillin proteolysis is triggered after mitotic exit by the [[Anaphase Promoting Complex]] (APC).</p>\n<p>Most anillins can be sequestered to the nucleus during [[interphase]], but there are exceptions – ''Drosophila'' anilins in the early embryo, C. elegans ANI-1 in early embryos, ''C. elegans'' ANI-2 in oogenic gonads, and Mid2p in fission yeast. These anillins that are not sequestered during interphase suggest that anillins may also regulate cytoskeletal dynamics outside the contractile ring during cytokinesis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zhang_2010&quot; /&gt;</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Anillin is critical for cell division and therefore development and homeostasis in metazoans. In recent years, the expression levels of anillin have been shown to correlate to the metastatic potential of human tumours. In colorectal cancer, expression levels of anillin are higher in tumours and when anillin was over-expressed in HT29 cells, a classical [[colorectal cancer]] cell line, the cells showed faster replication kinetics due to the lengthening of G2/M phase. Increasing the expression of anillin also led to further invasiveness and migration of numerous colorectal cancer cell lines. The hypothesis from such observations is that anillin promotes EMT and [[cell migration]] through cytoskeletal remodeling, leading to enhanced proliferation, invasion, and mobility of tumour cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | vauthors = Chuang HY, Ou YH | title = Overexpression of anillin in colorectal cancer promoter the cell proliferation, cell mobility and cell invasion. | conference = Proceedings of the 105th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research | location = San Diego, CA. | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid27062703&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang G, Shen W, Cui L, Chen W, Hu X, Fu J | title = Overexpression of Anillin (ANLN) is correlated with colorectal cancer progression and poor prognosis | journal = Cancer Biomarkers | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 459–65 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27062703 | doi = 10.3233/CBM-160585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\n",
