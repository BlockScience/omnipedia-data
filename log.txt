This primary page is supported by further [[:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style|detail pages]], which are cross-referenced here and listed at [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Contents]]. If any contradiction arises, this page has precedence.{{efn|name="CONLEVEL"|This is a matter of policy at {{section link|Wikipedia:Consensus|Level of consensus}}: "Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. For instance, unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right, participants in a wikiproject cannot decide that a Wikipedia policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope." And: "Wikipedia has a higher standard of participation and consensus for changes to policies and guidelines than to other types of pages." Subordinate pages include [[:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style|MoS detail pages]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide#Advice pages|style essays]], and the [[Wikipedia:Simplified Manual of Style|Simplified Manual of Style]].}}\n\n{{Anchor|Clarity}}Editors should write articles using straightforward, succinct, easily understood language and structure articles with consistent, reader-friendly layouts and formatting (which are detailed in this guide).\n\n{{Anchor|Stability}}Where more than one style or format is acceptable under the MoS, one should be used consistently within an article and [[#Retaining existing styles|should not be changed]] without good reason.

Seek [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Opportunities for commonality|opportunities for commonality]] to avoid disputes over style.\n\nIf you believe an alternative style would be more appropriate for a particular article, seek [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] by discussing this at the article\'s talk page or{{snd}}if it raises an issue of more general application or with the MoS itself{{snd}}at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style]]. If a discussion does not result in consensus for the change at the article, continue to use the already-established style there. If discussion fails to reach a consensus regarding which of two or more competing styles to use at all, then default to the style that was used in the first post-[[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]] version of the article in which one of the applicable styles appeared. (This fall-back position does not give [[WP:UNCHALLENGED|unchallengeable primacy]] to that particular style during consensus discussion, nor give the editor who imposed that earliest style [[Wikipedia:Ownership of content|any more say]] in the discussion.)\n\n{{Crossref|For retention of an article\'s established national variety of English (and potential reasons to change it), see {{section link||National varieties of English}}.}}\n\n==Article titles, sections, and headings <span class="anchor" id="Article titles, headings, and sections"></span>==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:AT}}\n\n===Article titles===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Article titles}}\n\nA title should be a recognizable name or description of the topic, [[Wikipedia:Common sense|balancing]] the criteria of being natural, sufficiently precise, concise, and consistent with those of related articles.\n\nFor formatting guidance see the {{section link|Wikipedia:Article titles|Article title format}} section, noting the following:\n*Capitalize the initial letter (except in rare cases, such as {{xt|eBay}}), but otherwise follow [[sentence case]]{{efn|name=Sentence case|1=Wikipedia uses [[sentence case]] for sentences, [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article titles]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout|section titles]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables|table headers]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Images|image captions]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists|list entries]] (in most cases), and entries in [[Wikipedia:Infobox|infoboxes]] and similar templates, among other things.

See [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)]].\n*To italicize, add {{tlx|italic title}} near the top of the article. For mixed situations, use, e.g., <code><nowiki>{{DISPLAYTITLE:</nowiki>{{zwsp}}<nowiki>Interpretations of \'\'2001: A Space Odyssey\'\'}}</nowiki></code>, instead. Use of italics should conform to {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting|Italic type}}.\n*Do not use [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (\'\'a\'\', \'\'an\'\', or \'\'the\'\') as the first word ({{xt|Economy of the Second Empire}}, not {{!xt|The economy of the Second Empire}}), unless it is an inseparable part of a name ({{xt|The Hague}}) or title of a work (\'\'{{xt|A Clockwork Orange}}\'\', \'\'{{xt|The Simpsons}}\'\').\n*Normally use [[noun]]s or [[noun phrase]]s: {{xt|Early life}}, not {{!xt|In early life}}.{{Efn|1=Phrases such as {{xt|In early life}} are acceptable (though not required) as section headings. They are also used frequently as part of longer article titles such as [[Piracy in the Caribbean|{{xt|Piracy in the Caribbean}}]], especially when a shorter construction ({{xtn|Caribbean piracy}}) may have ambiguity issues.}}\n*The final character should not be punctuation unless it is an inseparable part of a name ({{xt|[[Saint-Louis-du-Ha!

The remainder of the article is typically divided into [[Help:Section|sections]].\n\n[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|Infoboxes]], images, and related content in the lead section must be right-aligned.\n\nCertain standardized [[Help:Template|templates]] and [[Help:Wikitext|wikicode]] that are not sections go at the very top of the article, before the content of the lead section, and in the following order:\n*A [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]], with the {{tlx|Short description}} template\n*A [[Wikipedia:Hatnote|disambiguation hatnote]], most of the time with the {{tlx|Hatnote}} template {{crossref|(see also {{section link|Wikipedia:Hatnote#Hatnote templates}})}}\n*No-output templates that indicate the article\'s established date format and English-language variety, if any (e.g., {{tlx|Use dmy dates}}, {{tlx|Use Canadian English}})\n*Banner-type maintenance templates, [[Wikipedia:Template index/Disputes|Dispute]] and [[Wikipedia:Template index/Cleanup|Cleanup templates]] for article-wide issues that have been flagged (otherwise used at the top of a specific section, after any sectional hatnote such as {{tlx|main}})\n*An [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|infobox]], which is optional (except in special cases like {{tlx|Taxobox}} and {{tlx|Chembox}}, or a variant thereof, at applicable articles); usually also includes the first image\n*An introductory image, when an infobox is not used, or an additional image is desired for the lead section (for unusually long leads, a second image can be placed midway through the lead text)\n\nIn the [[Vector 2022]] skin, the [[Wikipedia:Table of contents|table of contents]] is separate from the article content. In some older skins, a navigable table of contents appears automatically just after the lead if an article has at least four section headings.\n\nIf the topic of a section is covered in more detail in a dedicated article {{cross reference|(see [[Wikipedia:Summary style]])}}, insert {{tlx|main|{{var|Article name}}}} or {{tlx|further|{{var|Article name}}}} immediately under the section heading.\n\nAs explained in detail in {{slink|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout|Standard appendices and footers}}, several kinds of material (mostly optional) may appear after the main body of the article, in the following order:\n*Books or other works created by the subject of the article, under a section heading "Works", "Publications", "Discography", "Filmography", etc. as appropriate (avoid "Bibliography", confusable with reference citations)\n*Internal links to related English Wikipedia articles, with section heading "See also"\n*Notes and references, with a section heading "Notes" or "References" (usually the latter), or a separate section for each in this order {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]])}}; avoid "Bibliography", confusable with the subject\'s works\n*Relevant books, articles, or other publications that have not been used as sources; use the section heading "Further reading"; be highly selective, as [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a directory|Wikipedia is not a bibliographic directory]]\n*Relevant [[Wikipedia:External links|and appropriate]] websites that have not been used as sources and do not appear in the earlier appendices, using the heading "External links", which may be made a subsection of "Further reading" (or such links can be integrated directly into the "Further reading" list instead); [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Links to sister projects|link templates for sister-project content]] also usually go at the top of this section when it is present (otherwise in the last section on the page)\n*The following final items never take section headings:\n**Internal links organized into [[Wikipedia:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates#Navigation_templates|navigational boxes]]\n**[[Wikipedia:Authority control|Authority control]] metadata, if needed, using {{tlx|Authority control}} (distinguishes uses of the same name for two subjects, or multiple names for one subject)\n**[[Wikipedia:Categorization|Categories]], which should be the very last material in the article\'s source code if there are no stub templates\n**[[Wikipedia:Stub sorting|Stub templates]], if needed, which should follow the categories\n\n[[Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists|Stand-alone list articles]] have some additional layout considerations.\n\n===Section headings<span class="anchor" id="Section management"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HEAD|MOS:HEADINGS|MOS:SECTIONS|MOS:SECTIONHEAD}}\n{{See also|Help:Section|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Headings|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Order of article elements|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Section headings}}\n\nSection headings should generally follow the guidance for [[#Article titles|article titles]] (above), and should be presented in [[sentence case]] ({{xt|Funding of UNESCO projects in developing countries}}), not title case ({{!xt|Funding of UNESCO Projects in Developing Countries}}).{{efn|name=Sentence case}}\n\n{{shortcut|MOS:BLANKLINE}}\n{{Anchor|Blank line}}\nThe heading must be on its own line, with one blank line just before it;

That advanced search does not search [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], so also check the article\'s [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] page for redirects to the old section title. If there are only a small number of links to the old section title, it may be better to just update them. }} create an [[Help:Anchor|anchor]] with that title to ensure that these still work. Similarly, when linking to a section, leave an invisible comment at the heading of the target section, naming the linking articles, so that if the heading is later altered these can be fixed. For (a combined) example:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code><nowiki>==Implications{{subst:</nowiki>[[Template:Anchor|Anchor]]<nowiki>|Consequences}}==</nowiki><br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\nwhich will be saved in the article as:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code>==Implications{{code|1={{Anchor|Consequences}}}}==<br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\n\nThe advantage of using <code><nowiki>{{subst:Anchor}}</nowiki></code>, or simply inserting the <code><nowiki><span></nowiki></code> tags directly, is that when edits are made to the section in the future, the anchor will not be included in page history entries as part of the section name. When <code><nowiki>{{Anchor}}</nowiki></code> is used directly, that undesirable behavior \'\'does\'\' occur. Note: if electing to insert the span directly, do not abbreviate it by using a self-closing tag, as in <code><nowiki>==Implications<span id="Consequences" />==</nowiki></code>, since in HTML5 that XML-style syntax is valid only for certain tags, such as {{nowrap |<code>&lt;br /></code>}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T134423 |title=T134423 Deprecate nonstandard behavior of self-closed HTML tags in wikitext. |website=phabricator.wikimedia.org |access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Avoiding broken section links}} for further discussion.\n\n====Heading-like material====\nThe above guidance about sentence case, redundancy, images, and questions also applies to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|headers of tables]] (and of table columns and rows). However, table headings can incorporate citations and may begin with, or be, numbers. Unlike page headings, table headers do not automatically generate link anchors. Aside from sentence case in glossaries, the heading advice also applies to the \'\'term\'\' entries in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#DLIST|description lists]]. If using [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Glossaries#Linking|template-structured glossaries]], terms will automatically have link anchors, but will not otherwise. Citations for description-list content go in the \'\'term\'\' or \'\'definition\'\' element, as needed.\n\n==National varieties of English==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ENGVAR}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Article titles#National varieties of English|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Spelling}}\n\nNational varieties of English (for example, [[American English]] or [[British English]]) differ in vocabulary (\'\'elevator\'\' vs. \'\'lift\'\'{{hairspace}}), spelling (\'\'center\'\' vs. \'\'centre\'\'), and occasionally grammar {{crossref|(see {{section link||Plurals}}, below)}}. Articles such as [[English plurals]] and [[Comparison of American and British English]] provide information about such differences. The English Wikipedia prefers no national variety over others.\n\nAn article\'s date formatting ({{xt|{{#time: F j, Y}}}} vs. {{xt|{{#time: j F Y}}}}) is also related to national varieties of English{{snd}}see [[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] and especially [[MOS:DATETIES]] and [[MOS:DATEVAR]].\n\n===Consistency within articles<span class="anchor" id="Internal consistency"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ARTCON|MOS:CONSISTENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Consistency}}\nThe conventions of a particular variety of English should be followed consistently within a given article. Exceptions include:\n*\'\'\'Quotations\'\'\' and \'\'\'titles of works\'\'\' (such as books, films, and music) should be given as they appear in sources. However, there are certain situations where this principle is not followed in order to maintain a level of typographic conformity across the encyclopedia: see {{section link||Typographic conformity}}.\n*\'\'\'Proper names\'\'\' use the subject\'s own spelling, e.g., {{xt|joint project of the United States Department of Defense and the Australian Defence Force}}; {{xt|International Labour Organization}}<!--This example is here because it uses -our and -ization at the same time; it is Oxford spelling.-->;\n*For articles about chemistry-related topics, the international standard spellings {{xt|aluminium}}, {{xt|sulfur}}, {{xt|caesium}} (and derivative terms) should be used regardless of the variety of English otherwise employed in the article. See {{section link|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)|Element names}}.\n\n===Opportunities for commonality===\n{{shortcut|MOS:COMMONALITY}}\n\nFor an international encyclopedia, using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable.\n*Use universally accepted terms rather than those less widely distributed, especially in titles. For example, [[Glasses|{{xt|glasses}}]] is preferred to the national varieties {{!xt|spectacles}} ([[British English]]) and {{!xt|eyeglasses}} ([[American English]]); [[Ten million|{{xt|ten million}}]] is preferable to [[crore|{{!xt|one crore}}]] ([[Indian English]]).\n*If a variant spelling appears in a title, make a [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirect]] page to accommodate the others, as with [[artefact]] and [[artifact]], so that all variants can be used in searches and linking.\n*Terms that differ between varieties of English, or that have divergent meanings, may be [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|glossed]] to prevent confusion, for example, {{xt|the trunk (American English) or boot (British English) of a car&nbsp;...}}.\n*Use a commonly understood word or phrase in preference to one that has a different meaning because of national differences (rather than {{!xt|alternate}}, use {{xt|alternative}} or {{xt|alternating}}, as appropriate), except in technical contexts where such substitution would be inappropriate ({{xt|alternate leaves}}; {{xt|alternate law}}).\n*When more than one variant spelling exists within a national variety of English, the most commonly used current variant should usually be preferred, except where the less common spelling has a specific usage in a specialized context, e.g., \'\'connexion\'\' in [[Connexionalism|Methodist connexionalism]].\n\n{{crossref|printworthy=y|For assistance with specific terms, see {{section link|Comparison of American and British English|Vocabulary}}, and [[American and British English spelling differences]]; most dictionaries also indicate regional terms.}}\n\n===Strong national ties to a topic===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:TIES}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Strong national ties to a topic|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Unit choice and order}}\n\nAn article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the (formal, not colloquial) English of that nation. For example:\n<!--\nPlease DO NOT add more examples here. This is not a list of English dialects.\nENGVAR is concerned with English varieties that exist in a codified, formal written register with their own style guides.\n-->\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Afrikaners]] ([[South African English]])\n*[[American Civil War]] ([[American English]])\n*[[Australian Defence Force]] ([[Australian English]])\n*[[Christchurch]] ([[New Zealand English]])\n*[[Dublin]] ([[Hiberno-English]])\n*[[Great Fire of London]] ([[British English]])\n*[[Lagos]] ([[Nigerian English]])\n*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] ([[Pakistani English]])\n*[[Mumbai]] ([[Indian English]])\n*[[Vancouver]] ([[Canadian English]])\n*[[Wanchai Tower]] ([[Hong Kong English]])\n}}\n\nFor topics with strong ties to [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries and other [[British Empire|former British territories]], use [[Commonwealth English]] orthography, largely indistinguishable from British English in encyclopedic writing (excepting Canada, which uses [[Canadian English#Spelling|a different orthography]]).\n\n===Retaining the existing variety===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:RETAIN}}\n{{See also|#Retaining existing styles|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Retaining the existing format}}\n{{redirect|WP:RETAIN|the general editing policy|WP:PRESERVE|the title policy|WP:TITLEVAR}}\n\nWhen an English variety\'s [[#Consistency within articles|consistent usage]] has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary. With few exceptions (e.g., when a topic has [[#Strong national ties to a topic|strong national ties]] or the change reduces ambiguity), there is no valid reason for changing from one acceptable option to another.\n\n{{anchor|FPSR|FMC}}When no English variety has been established and discussion does not resolve the issue, use the variety found in the first post-[[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]] revision that introduced an identifiable variety. The established variety in a given article can be documented by placing the appropriate [[:Category:Varieties of English templates|variety of English template]] on its talk page.\n\nAn article should not be edited or renamed simply to switch from one variety of English to another. {{tlxs|uw-engvar}} may be placed on an editor\'s talk page to explain this.\n\n==Capital letters==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters}}\n\nWikipedia article titles and section headings use sentence case, not title case; see [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] and {{section link||Section headings}}. For capitalization of list items, see {{section link||Bulleted and numbered lists}}. Other points concerning capitalization are summarized below. Full information can be found at [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters]]. The central point is that Wikipedia does not capitalize something unless it is consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].\n\n===Capitalization of \'\'The\'\'===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of The}}\n\nGenerally, do not capitalize the word \'\'the\'\' in mid-sentence: {{xt|throughout the United Kingdom}}, not {{!xt|throughout The United Kingdom}}. Conventional exceptions include certain proper names ({{xt|he visited The Hague}}) and most titles of creative works ({{xt|Tolkien wrote \'\'The Lord of the Rings\'\'}}{{snd}}but be aware that \'\'the\'\' may not be part of the title itself, e.g., {{xt|Homer composed the \'\'Odyssey\'\'}}).\n\nThere are special considerations for: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Music#Names (definite article)|band names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Institutions|institution names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#NICKNAMETHE|nicknames]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Indefinite and definite articles|titles of works]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks#TMTHE|trademarks]].\n\n===Titles of works<span id="Capitalization-Titles"></span>===\n{{main|WP:Manual of Style/Titles of works}}\n\nThe English-language titles of compositions (books and other print works, songs and other audio works, films and other visual media works, paintings and other artworks, etc.) are given in {{em|[[title case]]}}, in which every word is given an initial capital except for certain less important words (as detailed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters|Composition titles}}). The first and last words in an English-language title are always capitalized.\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'An Eye for an Eye\'\'}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'Worth the Fighting For\'\'}}\n\nCapitalization in non-English language titles varies, even over time within the same language; generally, retain the style of the original for modern works, and follow the usage in current{{efn|name=recent}} English-language reliable sources for historical works. When written in the Latin alphabet, many of these items should also be in [[#Italics|italics]], or enclosed in [[#Names and titles|quotation marks]].\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|"{{lang|de|italics=no|Hymnus an den heiligen Geist}}"}}\n\n===Titles of people===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Titles of people}}\n*\'\'\'In generic use\'\'\', use lower case for words such as \'\'president\'\', \'\'king\'\', and \'\'emperor\'\' ({{xt|De Gaulle was a French president}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was a French king}}; {{xt|Three prime ministers attended the conference}}).\n*\'\'\'Directly before the person\'s name\'\'\', such words begin with a capital letter ({{xt|President Obama}}, not {{!xt|president Obama}}). Standard or commonly used names of an office are treated as proper names ({{xt|David Cameron was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom}}; {{xt|Hirohito was Emperor of Japan}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}}).

"Standardized breed" lacks a perfectly clear meaning, but does encompass any breed subject to the [[breed standard]] or [[studbook]] of a notable breeder/fancier organization. Various other groupings of domesticated animals are not standardized breeds: ancient historical varieties, breed groups, feral populations, landraces, and [[crossbreed]]s or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] that no major organizations recognize as breeds. Many often are not [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] anyway.}} Examples: [[German Shepherd|{{xt|German Shepherd}}]], [[Russian White goat|{{xt|Russian White goat}}]], [[Berlin Short-faced Tumbler|{{xt|Berlin Short-faced Tumbler}}]]. As with plant cultivars, this applies whether or not the included noun is a proper name, in contrast to how vernacular names of species are written. However, unlike cultivars, breeds are never put in single quotation marks, and their names are never part of a scientific name. A species term appended at the end for disambiguation ("cat", "hound", "horse", "swine", etc.) should not be capitalized, unless it is a part of the breed name itself and is consistently presented that way in the breed standards (rare cases include [[Norwegian Forest Cat|{{xt|Norwegian Forest Cat}}]] and [[American Quarter Horse|{{xt|American Quarter Horse}}]]).\n\nCreate [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]] from alternative capitalization and spelling forms of article titles, and from alternative names, e.g., [[Adélie Penguin]], [[Adelie penguin]], [[Adelie Penguin]] and \'\'[[Pygoscelis adeliae]]\'\' should all redirect to [[Adélie penguin]].\n\n===Celestial bodies===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Celestial bodies}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (astronomical objects)}}\nThe words \'\'sun\'\', \'\'earth\'\', \'\'moon\'\' and \'\'solar system\'\' do not take capitals in general use ({{xt|The sun was over the mountain top}}; {{xt|The tribal people thought of the whole earth as their home}}). They are capitalized when the entity is personified ({{xt|Sol Invictus (\'Unconquered Sun\') was the Roman sun god}}) or when used as the name of a specific body in a scientific or astronomical context ({{xt|The Moon orbits the Earth}}; but {{xt|Io is a moon of Jupiter}}).\n\nNames of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, stars, constellations, and galaxies are proper names, and therefore capitalized ({{xt|The planet Mars is in the constellation Gemini, near the star Pollux}}). The first letter of every word in such a name is capitalized ({{xt|Alpha Centauri}} and not {{!xt|Alpha centauri}}; {{xt|Milky Way}}, not {{!xt|Milky way}}). Words such as \'\'comet\'\' and \'\'galaxy\'\' should be capitalized when they form part of a proper name, but not when they are used as a generic term ({{xt|Halley\'s Comet is the most famous of the comets}}; {{xt|The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy}}).\n\n===Compass points<span class="anchor" id="Compass"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Compass points}}\n\nDo not capitalize \'\'\'directions\'\'\' such as \'\'north\'\', or their related forms ({{xt|We took the northern road}}), except where they are parts of proper names ({{xt|Great North Road}}, {{xt|Great Western Drive}}, {{xt|South Pole}}).\n\nCapitalize \'\'\'names of regions\'\'\' if they have attained proper-name status, including informal conventional names ({{xt|Southern California}}; {{xt|the Western Desert}}), and derived terms for people (e.g., a \'\'Southerner\'\' as someone from the [[Southern United States]]). Do not capitalize descriptive names for regions that have not attained the status of proper names, such as {{xt|southern Poland}}.\n\nComposite directions may or may not be hyphenated, depending on the [[#National varieties of English|variety of English adopted]] in the article. {{xt|Southeast Asia}} and {{xt|northwest}} are more common in American English; but {{xt|South-East Asia}} and {{xt|north-west}} in British English.

Do not capitalize \'\'the\'\' at the start of an institution\'s name, regardless of the institution\'s preferred style. There are rare exceptions, when a leading \'\'The\'\' is represented by a \'\'T\'\' in the organization\'s acronym: {{xt|The International Cat Association (TICA)}}.\n\nTreat political or geographic units similarly: {{xt|The city has a population of 55,000}};{{nbsp}} {{xt|The two towns merged to become the City of Smithville}}. Do not mimic the style of local newspapers which refer to their municipality as \'\'the City\'\' or \'\'The City\'\'; an exception is the [[City of London]], referred to as {{xt|the City}} in a context that already makes the subject clear, as distinct from [[London]] and [[Greater London]]. When in doubt, use the full name for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]] reasons; users of text-to-speech systems usually cannot hear a difference between \'\'city\'\' and \'\'City\'\'.\n\n==Ligatures==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)#Modified letters}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LIG|MOS:LIGATURE}}\n\n[[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] should be used in languages in which they are standard (hence {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'œil\'\'}} is preferable to {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'oeil\'\'}}) but not in English ({{xt|encyclopedia}} or {{xt|encyclopaedia}}, not {{!xt|encyclopædia}}), except in proper names ({{xt|Æthelstan}}, not {{!xt|Aethelstan}}).\n\n==Abbreviations<span class="anchor" id="Acronyms and abbreviations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Acronyms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Initialisms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Shortenings"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Initials}}\n\nAbbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. In strict analysis, they are distinct from [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], which use an [[apostrophe]] (e.g., \'\'won\'t\'\', see {{Section link||Contractions}}), and [[initialism]]s. An initialism is formed from some or all of the initial letters of words in a phrase. Below, references to abbreviations should be taken to include acronyms, and the term \'\'acronym\'\' to apply also to initialisms.\n\n===Write first occurrences in full===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:1STOCC|MOS:1STABBR}}\n\nWhen an abbreviation will be used in an article, first introduce it using the full expression:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|an early local area network (LAN) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC){{nbsp}}... DEC\'s later LAN products were{{nbsp}}...}}}}\n\nDo not use capitals in the full version merely because capitals are used in the abbreviation: {{!xt|an early Local Area Network (LAN)}}.\n\nExcept in special circumstances, common abbreviations (such as {{xt|PhD}}, {{xt|DNA}}, {{xt|USSR}}) need not be expanded even on first use.\n\n===Plural forms===\nPluralize [[acronyms]] by adding \'\'-s\'\' or \'\'-es\'\': {{xt|Three CD-ROMs and two BIOSes were released}}. Do not [[Apostrophe#Abbreviations|use apostrophes to form plurals]]: {{!xt|Three CD-ROM\'s and two BIOS\'s were released}}.\n\n===Punctuation and spacing<span class="anchor" id="Periods (full stops) and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="Full stops and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="op.cit."></span>===\nAn abbreviation may or may not be terminated with a full point (also called a \'\'period\'\' or \'\'full stop\'\'). A consistent style should be maintained within an article. North American usage is typically to end all abbreviations with a period/point ({{xt|Dr. Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St.}}) but in common British and Australian usage, no period/point is used if the abbreviation (contraction) ends in the last letter of the unabbreviated form ({{xt|Dr Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St}}) unless confusion could result. This is also common practice in scientific writing. Regardless of punctuation, words that are abbreviated to more than one letter are spaced ({{xt|op.&nbsp;cit.}} not {{!xt|op.cit.}} or {{!xt|opcit}}). There are some exceptions: {{xt|PhD}} {{crossref|(see above)}} for "Philosophiae Doctor"; {{xt|BVetMed}} for "Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine". In most situations, Wikipedia uses no such punctuation inside acronyms and initialisms: {{xt|GDP}}, not {{!xt|G.D.P.}}\n\n===US and U.S.<span class="anchor" id="US"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S."></span><span class="anchor" id="USA"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S.A."></span>===\n{{redirect|MOS:US|the use of the word "us"|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#First-person pronouns}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:US|MOS:USA|MOS:NOTUSA}}\n{{xt|US}} is a commonly used abbreviation for {{xt|United States}}, although {{xtn|U.S.}} – with periods and without a space – remains common in North American publications, including in news journalism.  Multiple American style guides, including \'\'[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]\'\' (since 2010), now deprecate "U.S." and recommend "US".\n\nFor [[#Opportunities for commonality|commonality]] reasons, use {{xt|US}} by default when abbreviating, but [[#Retaining existing styles|retain]] {{xtn|U.S.}} in American or Canadian English articles in which it is already established, unless there is a good reason to change it. Because use of periods for abbreviations and acronyms should be consistent within any given article, use {{xt|US}} in an article with other country abbreviations, and especially avoid constructions like {{!xt|the U.S. and the UK}}. In longer abbreviations that incorporate the country\'s initials ({{xt|USN}}, {{xt|USAF}}), never use periods. When the United States is mentioned with one or more other countries in the same sentence, {{xt|US}} (or {{xtn|U.S.}}) may be too informal, especially at the first mention or as a noun instead of an adjective ({{xt|France and the United States}}, not {{!xt|France and the US}}). Do not use the spaced {{!xt|U.&nbsp;S.}} or the archaic {{!xt|U.S.&nbsp;of&nbsp;A.}}, except when quoting. Do not use {{!xt|U.S.A.}} or {{!xt|USA}} except in a quotation, as part of a proper name ({{xt|Team USA}}), or in certain technical and formal uses (e.g., the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]], [[FIFA country codes|FIFA]], and [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country codes]]).\n\n===Circa===\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Uncertain, incomplete, or approximate dates}} for examples.}}\n\nTo indicate \'\'approximately\'\', the use of {{tlx|circa}}, showing as {{circa}}, is preferred over circa, c., ca., or approx.\n\n===Avoid unwarranted use===\n<span class="anchor" id="unwarranted abbreviations"></span>\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Units of measurement}} for when to abbreviate units of measurement.}}\n\nAvoid abbreviations when they might confuse the reader, interrupt the flow, or appear informal. For example:\n*Do not use {{!xt|approx.}} for {{xt|approximate(ly)}} except in an infobox or table (in which case use {{tlx|abbr|approx.|approximately}} at first occurrence: {{xt|{{abbr|approx.|approximately}}}}).\n*Do not use the legalism {{!xt|Smith J}} for {{xt|Justice Smith}}. <!-- this might be better in [[WP:JARGON]] -->\n\n===Do not invent===\nAvoid devising [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary#Neologisms|new abbreviations]], especially acronyms. For example, {{xtn|World Union of Billiards}} is good as a {{em|translation}} of {{xt|[[Union Mondiale de Billard]]}}, but neither it nor the reduction {{!xt|WUB}} is used by the organization or by independent sources; use the original name and its official abbreviation, {{xt|UMB}}.\n\nIf it is necessary to abbreviate in a tight space, such as a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|column header in a table]], use widely recognized abbreviations. For example, for {{xt|New Zealand gross national product}}, use {{xt|NZ}} and {{xt|GNP}}, with a link if the term has not already been written out in the article: {{xt|NZ&nbsp;[[Measures of national income and output|GNP]]}}. Do not make up initialisms such as {{!xt|NZGNP}}.\n\n===HTML tags and templates===\nEither {{tag|abbr|o}} or {{tlx|abbr}} can be used for abbreviations and acronyms: {{tag|abbr|params=title="World Health Organization"|content=WHO|wrap=yes}} or {{tlx|abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}} will generate {{abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}}; [[mouseover|hovering]] over the rendered text causes a [[tooltip]] of the long form to pop up.\n\n===Ampersand===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:AMP|MOS:&}}\n\nIn normal text and headings, use \'\'and\'\' instead of the [[ampersand]] (\'\'&\'\'): {{xt|January 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2}}, not {{!xt|January 1&nbsp;&&nbsp;2}}. But retain an ampersand when it is a legitimate part of the style of a proper noun, the title of a work, or a trademark, such as in \'\'[[Up & Down (Horace Parlan album)|Up&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Down]]\'\' or [[AT&T]]. Elsewhere, ampersands may be used with consistency and discretion where space is extremely limited (e.g., tables and infoboxes). Quotations [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Typographic conformity|may be cautiously modified]], especially for consistency where different editions are quoted, as modern editions of old texts routinely replace ampersands with \'\'and\'\' (just as they replace other disused [[glyph]]s, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and abbreviations). Another frequent permissible but not required use is in short bibliographic references to works by multiple authors, e.g.: {{xt|<nowiki><ref>Lubbers & Scheepers (2002); Van Hiel & Mervielde (2002); Swyngedouw & Giles (2007); Van Hiel (2012).</ref></nowiki>}}.\n\n==Italics==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IT|MOS:ITAL}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Italic type}}\n\n===Emphasis<span id="Do not use capitals for emphasis"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Emphasis}}\n\nItalics are used for emphasis, rather than [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Boldface|boldface]] or [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#All caps and small caps|capitals]]. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.\n\nUse {{tag|em}} or {{tlx|em|...}} for emphasis.

When a whole sentence is mentioned, double quotation marks may be used instead, with consistency ({{xt|The preposition in \'\'She sat on the chair\'\' is \'\'on\'\'}}; or {{xt|The preposition in "She sat on the chair" is "on"}}). Quotation marks may also be used for shorter material to avoid confusion, such as when italics are already heavily used in the page for another purpose (e.g., for many non-English words and phrases). {{em|Mentioning}} (to discuss grammar, wording, punctuation, etc.) is different from {{em|quoting}} (in which something is usually expressed on behalf of a quoted source). Quotation is done with quotation marks, never italics, nor both at once {{crossref|(see {{section link||Quotations}} for details).}}\n\nA closely related use of italics is when introducing or distinguishing terms: {{xt|The \'\'natural numbers\'\' are the integers greater than 0.}}\n\n===Non-English words <span class="anchor" id="Foreign words"></span> ===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English terms}}\nItalics are indicated for non-English phrases and isolated non-English words that are not commonly used in everyday English. However, proper names (such as place names) in other languages are not usually italicized, nor are terms in non-Latin scripts. The {{tlx|lang}} template and its variants support all [[ISO 639]] language codes, correctly identifying the language and automatically italicizing for you.

While quotations are an indispensable part of Wikipedia, try not to overuse them. Using too many quotes is incompatible with an encyclopedic writing style and may be [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright infringement]], and so most of the content should be in the editor\'s own words. Consider paraphrasing quotations into plain and concise text when appropriate (while being aware that [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing|close paraphrasing]] can still violate copyright). [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Quotations|It is incorrect to put quotations in italics]] unless the material would be italicized for some other reason.\n\nPer [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|the verifiability policy]], direct quotations \'\'must\'\' be accompanied by an [[WP:INCITE|inline citation]] from a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] that supports the material.

Where there is good reason to change the wording, bracket the changed text; for example, {{!xt|"Ocyrhoe told him his fate"}} might be quoted as {{xt|"Ocyrhoe told [her father] his fate"}}.

Legitimate omissions include extraneous, irrelevant, or parenthetical words, and unintelligible speech ({{!xt|umm}} and {{!xt|hmm}}), but do not omit text where doing so would remove important context or alter the meaning of the text.

These are alterations which make no difference when the text is read aloud, for example:\n\n*Normalize dashes and hyphens: see {{Section link||Dashes}}. Use the style chosen for the article: unspaced [[em dash]] or spaced [[en dash]].\n*Convert apostrophes and quotation marks to Wikipedia\'s style:\n**These should be straight, not curly or slanted. See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.\n**When quoting a quotation that itself contains a quotation, alternate between using double and single quotes for each quotation. See {{section link||For a quotation within a quotation}} for details.\n*When quoting text from non-English languages, the outer punctuation should follow [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation marks|the Manual of Style for English quote marks]]. If there are nested quotations, follow the rules for correct punctuation in that language. If there are multiple styles for a language, the one used by the Wikipedia for that language is preferred unless the punctuation itself is under discussion.\n*:{{xt|The cynical response "{{lang|fr|italic=unset|L\'auteur aurait dû demander&nbsp;: «&nbsp;à quoi sert-il d\'écrire ceci&nbsp;?&nbsp;» mais ne l\'a pas fait}}" was all he wrote.}}\n*Remove spaces before punctuation such as periods and colons.\n*Generally preserve bold and italics {{cross reference|(see {{section link||Italics}})}}, but most other styling should be altered. {{!xt|{{Underline|Underlining}}}}, {{!xt|spac&nbsp;ing}} within words, {{!xt|1=co<span style="color:Goldenrod;">lor</span>s}}, {{!xt|ALL CAPS}}, {{Smallcaps|{{!xt|small caps}}}}, etc. should generally be normalized to plain text. If it {{em|clearly}} indicates emphasis, use italic {{em|emphasis}} ({{tlx|em}}) or, in an already-italic passage, boldface (with {{tlx|strong}}). For titles of books, articles, poems, and so forth, use italics or quotation marks following [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles|the guidance for titles]]. Italics can also be added to mark up [[#Non-English term|non-English terms]] (with the {{tlx|lang}} template), for an [[#Animals, plants, and other organisms|organism\'s scientific name]], and to indicate a [[#Words as words|words-as-words]] usage.\n*Expand an abbreviation (not already used in the content before the quotation) as a square-bracketed change, or explain it using {{tlx|abbr}}.\n*Normalize archaic glyphs and ligatures in English that are unnecessary to the meaning. Examples include \'\'[[æ]]\'\'→\'\'ae\'\', \'\'[[œ]]\'\'→\'\'oe\'\', \'\'[[Long s|ſ]]\'\'→\'\'s\'\', and \'\'[[Thorn (letter)#Abbreviations|þ<sup>e</sup>]]\'\'→\'\'the\'\'. {{crossref|(See also {{section link||Ampersand}}.)}}\n\n{{crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Typographic conformity}} for special considerations in normalizing the typography of titles of works.}}\n\nHowever, national varieties should not be changed, as these may involve changes in vocabulary. For example, a quotation from a British source should retain British spelling, even in an article that otherwise uses American spelling. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Consistency within articles}}.)}} Numbers also usually [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Quotations, titles, etc.|should not be reformatted]].\n\nDirect quotation should not be used to preserve the formatting preferred by an external publisher (especially when the material would otherwise be unchanged), as this tends to have the effect of [[Scare quotes|scare-quoting]]:\n*{{em|Acceptable}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n*{{em|Unacceptable}}: {{!xt|The animal is listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nItalics can be used to mark a particular usage as a [[term of art]] (a case of "[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words as words]]"), especially when it is unfamiliar or should not be reworded by a non-expert:\n*{{em|Permissible}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as \'\'critically endangered\'\' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nWhen quoting a complete sentence, it is usually recommended to keep the first word capitalized. However, if the quoted passage has been integrated into the surrounding sentence (for example, with an introduction such as "{{var|X}} said that"), the original capital letter may be lower-cased.\n*{{xt|LaVesque\'s report stated: "The equipment was selected for its low price.

Where possible, link from text outside of the quotation instead – either before it or soon after. (If quoting [[hypertext]], add an editorial note, {{xt|[link in original]}} or {{xt|[link added]}}, as appropriate, to avoid ambiguity as to whether the link was made by the original author.)\n\n===Block quotations<span class="anchor" id="Block quotations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Block quotes"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:BQ|MOS:BLOCKQUOTE}}\n\nFormat a long quote (more than about forty words or a few hundred characters, or consisting of more than one paragraph, regardless of length) as a [[block quotation]], indented on both sides. Block quotations should be enclosed in {{tlx|blockquote}}.\n\nDo not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid large, decorative quotation marks; those provided by the {{tlx|cquote}} template have been disabled in mainspace). Block quotations using a colored background are also discouraged.\n\nUse {{tnull|blockquote}} and so on only for actual quotations; [[#Indentation|indentation for other purposes]] is done differently.\n\nIt is conventional to precede a block quotation with an introductory sentence (or sentence fragment) and append the source citation to that line. Alternatively, the {{tnull|blockquote}} template provides parameters for attribution and citation which will appear below the quotation. {{Crossref|(For use of dashes with attributions, see {{section link||Other uses for em dashes}}.)}} This below-quotation attribution style is intended for famous quotations and is unusual in articles because it may strike an inappropriate tone. A quotation with no cited source should be flagged with {{tlx|quote without source}}, or deleted.\n\nLine breaks and indentation inside a {{tnull|blockquote}} or {{tag|blockquote|o}} are generally ignored; use {{xtag|poem}} or {{tlx|poem quote}} for poetry, lyrics, and similar material:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">\n{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis gives:\n{{xt|{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}}}\n\nOr quote such material inline, with line breaks indicated by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}/</nowiki></code>, and paragraph or stanza breaks by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}//</nowiki></code>.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:PQ|MOS:PULLQUOTE}}\n{{Anchor|Pull quotes|Pull quote|Pull quotations|nocquote|reason=The old name of Template:Pull_quote was Template:Cquote, and "nocquote" was historically used to refer to this MOS section, which now has its own shortcuts.}}\n[[Pull quote]]s do not belong in Wikipedia articles.

Quotations that are translations should be explicitly distinguished from those that are not. Indicate the original source of a translation (if it is available, and not first published within Wikipedia), and the original language (if that is not clear from the context).\n\nIf the original, untranslated text is available, provide a reference for it or include it, as appropriate.\n\nWhen editors themselves translate text into English, care must always be taken to include the original text, {{em|in italics}} (except for non-Latin-based writing systems, and best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template which both italicizes as appropriate and provides language metadata); and to use actual and (if at all possible) common English words in the translation.

Include terminal punctuation within the quotation marks only if it was present in the original material, and otherwise place it after the closing quotation mark.

There should be no space next to the inner side of a bracket. An opening bracket should usually be preceded by a space. This may not be the case if it is preceded by an opening quotation mark, another opening bracket, or a portion of a word:\n*{{xt|He rose to address the meeting: "(Ahem)&nbsp;... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!"}}\n*{{xt|Only the royal characters in the play ([Prince] Hamlet and his family) habitually speak in blank verse.}}\n*{{xt|We journeyed on the Inter[continental].}}\n*{{xt|Most people are right-handed. (Some people are left-handed, but that does not make right-handed people "better" than left-handed people.)}}\n\nThere should be a space after a closing bracket, except where a punctuation mark follows (though a spaced dash would still be spaced after a closing bracket) and in unusual cases similar to those listed for opening brackets.\n\nAvoid adjacent sets of brackets. Either put the parenthetical phrases in one set separated by semicolons, or rewrite:\n*{{em|Avoid}}: {{!xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) (also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919; also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader. He was also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv.}}\n\nSquare brackets are used to indicate editorial replacements and insertions within quotations, though this should never alter the intended meaning. They serve three main purposes:\n*To clarify: {{xt|She attended [secondary] school}}, where this was the intended meaning, but the type of school was unstated in the original sentence.\n*To reduce the size of a quotation: {{xt|X contains Y, and under certain circumstances, X may contain Z as well}} may be reduced to {{xt|X contains Y [and sometimes Z]}}. When an ellipsis ({{xt|...}}) is used to indicate that material is removed from a direct quotation, it should not normally be bracketed. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Ellipses}} for an exceptional case.)}}\n*To make the grammar work: Referring to someone\'s statement {{xt|"I hate to do laundry"}}, one could properly write {{xt|She "hate[s] to do laundry"}}.\n\nIf a sentence includes subsidiary material enclosed in square or round brackets, it must still carry terminal punctuation {{em|after}} those brackets, regardless of any punctuation within the brackets. {{Block indent|{{xt|She refused all requests (except for basics such as food, medicine, etc.).}}}} However, if the entire sentence is within brackets, the closing punctuation falls within the brackets. {{xt|(This sentence is an example.)}}\n\n====Brackets and linking====\nSquare brackets inside of links must be [[Escape character|escaped]]:\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n| He said, "<code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[[John Doe|John &amp;#91;Doe&amp;#93;]]</nowiki>}}</code> answered." ||\nHe said, "[[John Doe|John &#91;Doe&#93;]] answered."\n|-\n| He said, "<code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[[John Doe|John {{bracket|Doe}}]]</nowiki>}}</code> answered." ||\nHe said, "[[John Doe|John {{bracket|Doe}}]] answered."\n|-\n| <code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[https://example.com On the first day &amp;#91;etc.&amp;#93;]</nowiki>}}</code> ||\n[https://example.com On the first day &#91;etc.&#93;]\n|-\n| <code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[https://example.com On the first day {{bracket|etc.}}]</nowiki>}}</code> ||\n[https://example.com On the first day {{bracket|etc.}}]\n|}\n\nThe {{xtag|nowiki}} markup can also be used: {{tag|nowiki|content=[Doe]}} or {{tag|nowiki|content=[etc.]}}.\n\nIf a URL itself contains square brackets, the wiki-text should use the [[URL encoding|URL-encoded]] form <code><nowiki>https://</nowiki>example.com/foo.php?query={{bxt|%5B}}xxx{{bxt|%5D}}yyy</code>, rather than&nbsp;...<code>query={{!bxt|&#91;}}xxx{{!bxt|&#93;}}yyy</code>.

London, Paris{{nbsp}}...?"</nowiki></code>}} (Place terminal punctuation after an ellipsis only if it is textually important, as is often the case with exclamation marks and question marks but rarely with periods.)\n**Or, if the ellipsis immediately follows a quotation mark, use no space before the ellipsis, and a non-breaking space after it:\n**: {{xt|<code><nowiki>He continued to pursue Smith ("...{{nbsp}}to the ends of the earth", he had sworn) until his own death.</nowiki></code>}}\n\n; {{visible anchor|Pause or suspension of speech}}\n: Three dots are occasionally used to represent a pause in or suspense of speech, in which case the punctuation is retained in its original form: {{xt|Virginia\'s startled reply was "Could he&nbsp;...? No, I can\'t believe it!"}}. When it indicates an incomplete word, no space is used between the word fragment(s) and the ellipsis: {{xt|The garbled transmission ended with "We are stranded near San L...o", interpreted as a reference to either San Leandro or San Lorenzo.}}\n; {{Anchor|Ellipses with square brackets}}With square brackets\n:Square brackets may be placed around an ellipsis that indicates omitted text to distinguish it from an ellipsis that is part of the quoted text: {{xt|She retorted: "How do I feel?

Serial commas are more helpful when article text is complex, such as a list with multi-word items (especially if one contains its own "\'\'and\'\'"{{--)}} or a series of probably unfamiliar terms.\n\nHowever, there are cases in which either omitting or including the serial comma results in ambiguity:\n\n{{Block indent|{{!xt|The author thanked her friends, Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley}} {{spnd}}which may list either four or more people (the friends and the two people named) or two people (O\'Connor and Marley, who are the friends).}}\n\n{{Block indent|{{!xt|The author thanked a friend, Sinéad O\'Connor, and Bob Marley}} {{spnd}}which may list either two people (O\'Connor, who is the friend, and Marley) or three people (the first being the friend, the second O\'Connor, and the third Marley).}}\n\nIn such cases of ambiguity, clarify one of four ways:\n*Add or remove the serial comma.\n*Use separate sentences, bullet lists, or some other structural change to clarify.\n*Recast the sentence ("friends" case):\n**To list two people: {{xt|The author thanked her friends Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley.}}\n***Clearer: {{xt|The author thanked two friends – Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley.}}\n**To list several people:\n**: {{xt|The author thanked Sinéad O\'Connor, Bob Marley and her friends}} or\n**: {{xt|The author thanked Sinéad O\'Connor, Bob Marley, and her friends}}.\n***But not: {{!xt|The author thanked Bob Marley, Sinéad O\'Connor[,] and her friends}} {{spnd}}introduces ambiguity about \'\'her\'\'.\n*Recast the sentence ("friend" case):\n**To list two people: {{xt|The author thanked Bob Marley and her friend, Sinéad O\'Connor.}}\n***Or be more specific when possible (the commas here set off non-restrictive [[Apposition|appositives]]): {{xt|The author thanked her childhood friend, Sinéad O\'Connor, and her mentor, Bob Marley.}}\n**To list three people: {{xt|The author thanked Bob Marley, Sinéad O\'Connor, and a friend.}}\n***Clarity with gender-specific terms such as \'\'mother\'\' can be tricky; {{!xt|The author thanked her mother, Kim Thayil, and Sinéad O\'Connor}} is unclear because readers may not know [[Kim Thayil]] is male and wouldn\'t be the same person as the mother.\n***Clearer: {{xt|The author thanked Kim Thayil, Sinéad O\'Connor, and her own mother}} or {{xt|The author thanked her mother and musicians Kim Thayil and Sinéad O\'Connor}}.\n\n===Colons===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COLON}}\n{{For|the "colon trick" (for linking to a category, image, or interwiki link without adding the page to the category, displaying the image, or adding the interwiki link)|Help:Colon trick}}\n\nA [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] ({{xt|:}}) introduces something that demonstrates, explains, or modifies what has come before, or is a list of items that has just been introduced. The items in such a list may be separated by commas, or if they are more complex and perhaps themselves contain commas, the items should be separated by semicolons or arranged in a bulleted list.\n\n{{Block indent|{{xt|We visited several tourist attractions: the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which I thought could fall at any moment; the Bridge of Sighs; the supposed birthplace of Petrarch, or at least the first known house in which he lived; and so many more.}}}}\n\nA colon may also be used to introduce [[Quotation marks in English#Quotations and speech|direct speech]] enclosed within quotation marks. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.)}}\n\nIn most cases, a colon works best with a complete grammatical sentence before it. When what follows the colon is also a complete sentence, start it with a capital letter, but otherwise do not capitalize after a colon except where doing so is needed for another reason, such as for a proper name. When a colon is being used as a separator in an article title, section heading, or list item, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\nExcept in technical usage ({{xt|a 3:1 ratio}}), no sentence should contain multiple colons, no space should precede a colon, and a space (but never a hyphen or dash) should follow the colon.\n\n===Semicolons===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SEMICOLON|MOS:COMMASPLICE|MOS:;}}\n{{for|usage in marking up description (definition) lists|Help:List#Description lists}}\n\nA [[semicolon]] ({{xt|;}}) is sometimes an alternative to a full stop (period), enabling related material to be kept in the same sentence; it marks a more decisive division in a sentence than a comma. If the semicolon separates clauses, normally each clause must be independent (meaning that it could stand on its own as a sentence). In many cases, only a comma or only a semicolon will be correct in a given sentence.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Though he had been here before, I did not recognize him.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Though he had been here before; I did not recognize him.}}\n|}\n\nAbove, "Though he had been here before" cannot stand on its own as a sentence, and therefore is not an independent clause.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|}\n\nThis incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses is known as a [[comma splice]]; however, in certain kinds of cases, a comma may be used where a semicolon would seem to be called for:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"Life is short, art is long."}} (two brief clauses in an [[aphorism]]; see \'\'[[Ars longa, vita brevis]]\'\')\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"I have studied it, you have not."}} (reporting brisk conversation, such as this reply of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\'s)\n|}\n\nA sentence may contain several semicolons, especially when the clauses are parallel in construction and meaning; multiple unrelated semicolons are often signs that the sentence should be divided into shorter sentences or otherwise refashioned.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Unwieldy}}:\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline; pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Better}}:\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are alkaline, and pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|}\n\nSemicolons are used in addition to commas to separate items in a listing, when commas alone would result in confusion.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Confusing}}:\n| {{!xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts, San Francisco, California, Singapore, and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Clear}}:\n| {{xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Singapore; and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|}\n\n====Semicolon before "however"====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HOWEVER}}\n\nThe meaning of a sentence containing a trailing clause that starts with the word \'\'however\'\' depends on the punctuation preceding that word. A common error is to use the wrong punctuation, thereby changing the meaning to one not intended.\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is an adverb meaning "nevertheless", it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; however, they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; nevertheless, they tried.}}\n|}\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is a conjunction meaning "in whatever manner", or "regardless of how", it may be preceded by a comma but not by a semicolon, and should not be followed by punctuation. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, however they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, regardless of how they tried.}}\n|}\n\nIn the first case, the clause that starts with "however" cannot be swapped with the first clause; in the second case this can be done without change of meaning:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|However they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|Regardless of how they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|}\n\nIf the two clauses cannot be swapped, a semicolon is required.\n\nA sentence or clause can also contain the word \'\'however\'\' in the middle, if it is an adverb meaning "although" that could have been placed at the beginning but does not start a new clause in mid-sentence.

Hyphenation clarifies when the letters brought into contact are the same ({{xt|non-negotiable}}, {{xt|sub-basement}}) or are vowels ({{xt|pre-industrial}}), or where a word is uncommon ({{xt|co-proposed}}, {{xt|re-target}}) or may be misread ({{xt|sub-era}}, not {{!xt|subera}}). Some words of these sorts are nevertheless common without the hyphen (e.g., {{xt|cooperation}} is more frequently attested than {{xtg|co-operation}} in contemporary English).{{efn|name=recent}}\n# To link related terms in [[compound modifier]]s:{{Efn|1=Specifically, compound [[attributive adjective|attributive]]s, which are modifiers of a noun that occur within the [[noun phrase]]. {{crossref|(See {{section link|English compound#Hyphenated compound modifiers}}.)}}}}\n#*Hyphens can aid ease of reading (that is, they can be {{xt|ease-of-reading}} aids) and are particularly useful in long noun phrases: {{xt|gas-phase reaction dynamics}}. But never insert a hyphen into a proper name ({{xt|Middle Eastern cuisine}}, not {{!xt|Middle-Eastern cuisine}}).\n#*A hyphen can help to disambiguate (some {{xt|short-story writers}} are quite tall; {{xt|a government-monitoring program}} is a program that monitors the government, whereas {{xt|a government monitoring program}} is a government program that monitors).\n#*Compounds that are hyphenated when used {{em|[[Attributive adjective|attributively]]}} (adjectives before the nouns they qualify: {{xt|a light-blue handbag}}, {{xt|a 34-year-old woman}}) or {{em|[[substantive]]ly}} (as a noun: {{xt|she is a 34-year-old}}) are usually not hyphenated when used {{em|[[Predicative expression|predicatively]]}} (descriptive phrase separated from the noun: {{xt|the handbag was light blue}}, {{xt|the woman is 34 years old}}). Where there would otherwise be a loss of clarity, however, a hyphen may be used in the predicative form as well ({{xt|hand-fed turkeys}}, {{xt|the turkeys were hand-fed}}). Awkward attributive hyphenation can sometimes be avoided with a simple rewording: {{xt|Hawaiian-native species}} → {{xt|native Hawaiian species}}.\n#*Avoid using a hyphen after a standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverb ({{xt|a newly available home}}, {{xt|a wholly owned subsidiary}}) unless part of a larger compound ({{xt|a slowly-but-surely strategy}}). In rare cases, a hyphen can improve clarity if a rewritten alternative is awkward, but rewording is usually preferable: {{!xt|The idea was clearly stated enough}} can be disambiguated as {{xt|The idea clearly was stated often enough}} or {{xt|The idea was stated with enough clarity}}.\n#*A few words ending in \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' function as both adjectives and adverbs ({{xt|a kindly-looking teacher}}; {{xt|a kindly provided facility}}). Some such dual-purpose words (like {{xt|early}}, {{xt|only}}, {{xt|northerly}}) are not standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverbs, because they are not formed by addition of \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' to an independent current-English adjective. These need careful treatment: {{xt|Early flowering plants appeared around 130&nbsp;million years ago}}, but {{xt|Early-flowering plants risk damage from winter frosts}}; {{xt|only child actors}} (no adult actors) but {{xt|only-child actors}} (actors without siblings).\n#*A hyphen is normally used when the adverb \'\'well\'\' precedes a participle used attributively ({{xt|a well-meaning gesture}}; but normally {{xt|a very well managed firm}}, because \'\'well\'\' itself is modified) and even predicatively, if \'\'well\'\' is necessary to, or alters, the sense of the adjective rather than simply intensifying it ({{xt|the gesture was well-meaning}}, {{xt|the child was well-behaved}}, but {{xt|the floor was well polished}}).\n#*In some cases, such as {{xt|diode–transistor logic}}, the independent status of the linked elements requires an en dash instead of a hyphen. {{crossref|pw=y|See {{Section link||Dashes}}.}}\n#*{{shortcut|MOS:SUSPENDED|MOS:HANGING}}Use a \'\'\'[[suspended hyphen]]\'\'\' (also called a \'\'hanging hyphen\'\') when two compound modifiers are separated ({{xt|two- and three-digit numbers}}; {{xt|a ten-car or -truck convoy}}; {{xt|sloping right- or leftward}}).\n#*Values and units used as compound modifiers are hyphenated only where the unit is given as a whole word; when using the unit symbol, separate it from the number with a [[non-breaking space]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).\n\n<div class="block-indent" style="padding-left: 5em; padding-right: 0; overflow: hidden;"><!--The underlying code adapted from {{block indent}} which doesn\'t work around wikitables.-->\n{| style="background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|9-mm gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9&nbsp;mm gap}} (markup: <code>9&amp;nbsp;mm gap</code>)\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}}&nbsp; &nbsp; || {{!xt|9&nbsp;millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9-millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12-hour shift}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12&nbsp;h shift}} (markup: <code>12&amp;nbsp;h shift</code>)\n|}\n</div>\n\n\'\'\'Multi-word hyphenated items:\'\'\' It is often possible to avoid multi-word hyphenated modifiers by rewording ({{xt|a four-CD soundtrack album}} may be easier to read as {{xt|a soundtrack album of four CDs}}). This is particularly important where converted units are involved ({{xt|the 6-hectare-limit (14.8-acre-limit) rule}} might be possible as {{xt|the rule imposing a limit of six hectares (14.8 acres)}}, and the ungainly {{!xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) -long tributary}} as simply {{xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) tributary}}).\n\nFor optional hyphenation of compound \'\'\'points of the compass\'\'\' such as \'\'southwest/south-west\'\', see {{section link||Compass points}}.\n\nDo not use a capital letter after a hyphen except for a proper name following the hyphen: {{xt|Graeco-Roman}} and {{xt|Mediterranean-style}}, but not {{!xt|Gandhi-Like}}. In titles of published works, when given in [[title case]], follow the capitalization rule for each part independently ({{xt|\'\'The Out-of-Towners\'\'}}), unless reliable sources consistently do otherwise in a particular case ({{xt|\'\'The History of Middle-earth\'\'}}).\n\nHyphenation rules in other languages may be different. Thus, in French a place name such as {{xt|Trois-Rivières}} (\'Three Rivers\') is hyphenated, when it would not be in English. Follow reliable sources in such cases.\n\n\'\'\'Spacing:\'\'\' A hyphen is never followed or preceded by a space, except when hanging {{crossref|(see above)}} or when used to display parts of words independently, such as {{xt|the prefix sub-}}{{nbsp}}and {{xt|the suffix{{nbsp}}-less}}.\n\n\'\'\'Image filenames and redirects:\'\'\' Image filenames are not part of the encyclopedic content; they are tools. They are most useful if they can be readily typed, so they usually use hyphens instead of dashes. Similarly, article titles with dashes should also have a corresponding redirect from a copy of the title with hyphens: for example, {{xt|[[Michelson-Morley experiment]]}} redirects to {{xt|[[Michelson–Morley experiment]]}}.\n\n\'\'\'Non-breaking:\'\'\' A [[non-breaking hyphen]] ({{tlx|nbhyph}}) will {{em|not}} be used as a point of line-wrap.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SHY|MOS:SOFTHYPHEN}}\n{{Anchor|shy}}\n\'\'\'Soft hyphens:\'\'\' Use [[soft hyphen]]s to mark locations where a word will be broken and hyphenated {{em|if necessary}} at the end of a line of text, usually in [[Longest English words|very long words]] or narrow spaces (such as captions, narrow table columns, or text adjacent to a very wide image), for example: {{tlx|shy|Penn|syl|va|nia and Mass|a|chu|setts style themselves com|mon|wealths.}}. Use sparingly to avoid making wikitext difficult to read and edit. For more information, see [[Help:Line-break handling#%3Cwbr /%3E and soft hyphens|Help:Line-break handling]].\n\n\'\'\'Encoding\'\'\': The hyphen is represented by the {{small|ASCII/UNICODE [[hyphen-minus|HYPHEN-MINUS]]}} character, which is entered by the hyphen or minus key on all standard keyboards. Do not use the {{small|[[Hyphen#Unicode|UNICODE HYPHEN]]}} character.\n\nHyphenation involves many subtleties that cannot be covered here; the rules and examples presented above illustrate the broad principles.\n\n=== Dashes<span id="Em dashes"></span><span id="Unspaced em dash"></span><span id="En dashes"></span><span id="Spaced en dash"></span> ===\n{{redirect|WP:DASH|the overview of Wikipedia discussions|Wikipedia:Dashboard}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:DASH|MOS:EMDASH|MOS:ENDASH}}\n\nTwo forms of dash are used on Wikipedia: \'\'\'[[en dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|–}}) and \'\'\'[[em dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|—}}). To enter them, click on them in the [[Help:CharInsert|CharInsert toolbar]], or enter them manually as:\n*<code>&amp;ndash;</code> or <code>&amp;mdash;</code>\n*{{tlx|endash}} or {{tlx|emdash}}\nDo not use a double hyphen (<code>--</code>) to stand in for a dash. {{crossref|(See also: [[Wikipedia:How to make dashes]].)}}\n\nSources use dashes in varying ways. For consistency and clarity, Wikipedia adopts the following principles.\n\n====In article titles====\nIn [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article titles]], do not use a hyphen ({{xt|-}}) as a substitute for an en dash, for example in \'\'[[eye–hand span]]\'\' (since \'\'eye\'\' does not modify \'\'hand\'\'). Nonetheless, to aid searching and linking, provide a redirect with hyphens replacing the en dash(es), as in \'\'[[eye-hand span]]\'\'. Similarly, provide [[Template:Category redirect|category redirects]] for categories containing dashes. When an en dash is being used as a separator in an article title or section heading, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\n====In running text====\n{{Anchor|DASHVAR}}\nDashes are often used to mark divisions within a sentence: in pairs (parenthetical dashes, instead of parentheses or pairs of commas) or singly (perhaps instead of a colon). They may also indicate an abrupt stop or interruption in reporting quoted speech. In all such cases, either unspaced em dashes or spaced en dashes can be used, with consistency maintained throughout a given article:\n*An em dash is <em>unspaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected—but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\n*An en dash is <em>spaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\nIdeally, an en dash should be preceded by a non-breaking space; this prevents the dash from appearing at the beginning of a line. The {{tlx|snd}} template may be used for this:\n{{Block indent|{{mxt|<nowiki>Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.</nowiki>}}}}\nDo not insert any spaces where an en dash should be unspaced {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}})}}.\n\nDashes can clarify a sentence\'s structure when commas, parentheses, or both are also being used.\n*{{xt|The book summarizes works of some major philosophers in chronological order: Descartes, Locke, Hume{{snd}}but not his \'\'Treatise\'\' (deemed too complex for the target audience){{snd}}and Kant.}}\n\n<span class="anchor" id="Spare the dash"></span>{{Shortcut|MOS:SPARETHEDASH|MOS:NOTRIPLEDASH}}\nUse dashes sparingly.

It is used to <em>join</em> components less strongly than a hyphen would {{crossref|(see {{section link||Hyphens}})}}; conversely, it may also <em>separate</em> components less strongly than a slash would {{crossref|(see {{Section link||Slashes}})}}. Consider the relationship that exists between two components when deciding what punctuation to place between them.\n\n====Other uses for em dashes====\nAn [[#Indentation|indented]] em dash may be used when attributing the source of a passage, such as a [[#Block quotations|block quotation]] or poem. This dash should not be fully spaced: however, for reasons related to [[Wikipedia:Reuse|metadata]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]], it is best to place a [[hair space]] between the dash and the name.{{efn|name=hairspace|The [[hair space]] should be done as {{mxt|{{tl|hair space}}}} because the actual Unicode character ({{hair space}}) is almost invisible, the meaning of the numerical HTML entity ({{!mxt|&amp;#8202;}}) is relatively obscure, and the named HTML entity "{{!mxt|&amp;hairsp;}}" is not standard and unsupported in some browsers.}} Most of Wikipedia\'s quotation templates provide this formatting automatically.\n\nFor example, {{mxt|{{tlp|in5}}—{{tl|hair space}}Charlotte Brontë}} will produce:\n\n{{in5}}—{{hair space}}Charlotte Brontë\n\n====Other dashes====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NEGATIVE}}\n\nDo not use [[Typewriter#Typewriter conventions|typewriter approximations]] or other substitutes, such as two hyphens ({{!xt|--}}), for em or en dashes.\n\nFor a negative sign or subtraction operator use {{Unichar|2212|MINUS SIGN|nlink=Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|html=}}, which can also be generated by clicking on the {{Code|−}} following the {{Code|±}} in the {{xt|Insert}} toolbar beneath the edit window.

Replace with clearer wording.\n\nAn example: {{!xt|The parent/instructor must be present at all times.}} Must both be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent and the instructor}}.) Must at least one be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent or the instructor}}.) Are they the same person? (Use a hyphen: {{xt|the parent-instructor}}.)\n\nIn circumstances involving a distinction or disjunction, the en dash {{crossref|(see above)}} is usually preferable to the slash: {{xt|the digital–analog distinction}}.\n\nAn unspaced slash may be used:\n*to indicate [[phonemic]] [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation|pronunciations]] ({{xt|\'\'rivet\'\' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈrɪvət/}}}});\n*in a fraction (<code>7/8</code>, but see other techniques at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Fractions and ratios}});\n*to indicate regular defined yearly periods that do not coincide with calendar years (e.g., {{xt|the 2009/2010 fiscal year}}), if that is the convention used in reliable sources (see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Long periods of time}} for further explanation);\n*to express a ratio, in a form in which a slash is conventionally used (e.g., {{xt|the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio for short}});\n*in an expression or abbreviation widely used outside Wikipedia (e.g., {{xt|n/a}} or {{xt|N/A}} for \'\'not applicable\'\').\n\nA spaced slash may be used:\n*to separate run-on lines in quoted poetry or song ({{xt|To be or not to be: that is the question:&nbsp;/ Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer&nbsp;/ The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune}}), or rarely in quoted prose, where careful marking of a paragraph break is textually important;\n*to separate items that include at least one internal space ({{xt|the NY&nbsp;31 east&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;370 exit}}), where for some reason use of a slash is unavoidable.\n\nTo avoid awkward linebreaks, code spaced slashes (and fraction slashes) with a non-breaking space on the left and a normal space on the right, as in: <code>My mama told me&amp;nbsp;/ You better shop around</code>. For short constructions, both spaces should be non-breaking: {{nobr|<code>x&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;y</code>}}. On the other hand, if two long words are connected by an unspaced slash, an {{tl|wbr}} added after the slash will allow a linebreak at that point.\n\nDo not use the [[backslash]] character ({{!xt|&nbsp;\\&nbsp;}}) in place of a slash.\n\nPrefer the division operator ({{xt|&nbsp;÷&nbsp;}}) to slash or fraction slash when representing elementary arithmetic in general text: {{xt|{{nowrap|10 ÷ 2 {{=}} 5}}}}. In more advanced mathematical formulas, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] or slash is preferred: <math>\\textstyle\\frac{x^n}{n!}</math> or {{xt|{{var|x}}<sup>{{var|n}}</sup>/{{var|n}}!}} {{cross reference|1=(see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Common mathematical symbols}} and [[Help:Displaying a formula]])}}.\n\n====And/or====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ANDOR}}\n\nAvoid writing {{!xt|and/or}} unless other constructions would be lengthy or awkward. Instead of {{!xt|Most had trauma and/or smoke inhalation}}, write simply {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation}} (which would normally be interpreted as an [[inclusive-or]] to imply \'\'or both\'\'); or, for emphasis or precision or both, write {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation or both}}. Where more than two possibilities are present, instead of {{!xt|x, y, and/or{{nbsp}}z}} write {{xt|one or more of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}} or {{xt|some or all of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}}.\n\n=== Symbols ===\nUnicode symbols are preferred over composed [[ASCII]] symbols for improved readability and accessibility.

Another exception are periodical publications carrying both, issue \'\'and\'\' number designations (typically one being a year-relative and the other an absolute value); they should be given in the form {{xt|2 #143}} in citations, or be spelt out as\n{{xt|{{Abbr|Iss.|Issue}} 2, {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 143}} in text.

If a quoted phrase or title ends in a question mark or exclamation mark, it may confuse readers as to the nature of the article sentence containing it, and so is usually better reworded to be mid-sentence. Where such a word or phrase occurs mid-sentence, new terminal punctuation (usually a period) must be added at the end.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Acceptable}}: || {{xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?}}\n|-\n| {{em|Better}}: || {{xt|Slovak, having grown tired of What Is This?, returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr..}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr.}}\n|}\n\n===Punctuation and footnotes===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:CITEPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTFOOT|MOS:REFPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTREF|MOS:REFSPACE|MOS:PF}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Citing sources}}\n\'\'\'Reference tags\'\'\' ({{tag|ref}}) are used to create \'\'[[Help:Footnotes|footnotes]]\'\' (also called \'\'endnotes\'\' or simply \'\'notes\'\'), as [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Inline citations|citation footnotes]] and sometimes [[Help:Explanatory notes|explanatory notes]].

See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics|Punctuation after formulae}}.\n\n==Dates and time==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Chronological items}}\n\nDates should be [[Wikipedia:Linking|linked]] only when they are germane and topical to the subject, as discussed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Chronological items}}. For ranges of dates and times, see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}}.\n\n===Time of day===\n{{Main|MOS:TIME}}\n\nTimes of day are normally expressed in figures rather than words. Context determines whether the [[12-hour clock|12-]] or the [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] format is more appropriate.\n*Twelve-hour clock times are written in one of two forms: {{xt|11:15&nbsp;a.m.}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;p.m.}}, or {{xt|11:15&nbsp;am}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;pm}} (wherein the spaces should be [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking]]). Use {{xt|noon}} and {{xt|midnight}} rather than {{!xt|12&nbsp;pm}} and {{!xt|12&nbsp;am}}; it may need to be specified whether \'\'midnight\'\' refers to the start or end of a date.\n*Twenty-four-hour clock times are written in the form {{xt|08:15}} and {{xt|22:55}}, with no suffix. Midnight written as {{xt|00:00}} begins the day; {{xt|24:00}} ends it.\n\n===Dates<span id="Choice of format"></span><span id="Days"></span>===\n{{Main|MOS:DATEFORMAT}}\n\nFull dates are formatted {{xt|{{nobr|10 June 1921}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10, 1921}}}}; or where the year is omitted, use {{xt|{{nobr|10 June}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10}}}}.\n*The dates in the \'\'text\'\' of any one article should all have the same format (day-first or month-first).\n**For date formats in citations, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Citation style}}.\n**Dates in quotations and titles are always left as-is.\n**If a numerical format is required (e.g., for conciseness in lists and tables), use the YYYY-MM-DD format: {{xt|{{nobr|2005-04-03}}}}.\n*Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the more common date format for that country (month-first for the US, except in military usage; day-first for most others; articles related to Canada may use either consistently). Otherwise, do not change an article from one date format to the other without good reason.\n\n===Months===\n{{Main|MOS:MONTH}}\n*For month and year, write {{xt|June 1921}}, with no comma.\n*Abbreviations for months, such as {{xt|Feb}}, are used only where space is extremely limited. Such abbreviations should use three letters only, and should not be followed by a period (full point) except at the end of a sentence.\n\n===Seasons===\n{{Main|MOS:SEASON}}\n*Avoid ambiguous references to [[seasons]], which are different in the southern and northern hemispheres.\n*Names of seasons may be used when there is a logical connection to the event being described ({{xt|the autumn harvest}}) or when referring to a phase of a natural yearly cycle ({{xt|migration typically starts in mid-spring}}). Otherwise, neutral wording is usually preferable ({{xt|He was elected in November 1992}}, not {{!xt|He was elected in the fall of 1992}}).\n*Journals and other publications that are issued seasonally (e.g., "Summer 2005") should be dated as such in citations {{crossref|(for more information, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Seasonal publication dates and differing calendar systems}})}}.\n\n===Years and longer periods===\n{{Main|MOS:DECADE|MOS:CENTURY|MOS:ERA}}\n*Do not use \'\'the year\'\' before the digits ({{xt|1995}}, not {{!xt|the year 1995}}), unless the meaning would otherwise be unclear.\n*Decades are written in the format {{xt|the 1980s}}, with no apostrophe. Use the two-digit form (\'80s) only with an established social or cultural meaning. Avoid forms such as {{!xt|the 1700s}} that could refer to ten or a hundred years.\n*Years are denoted by [[Anno Domini|AD and BC]] or, equivalently, [[Common Era|CE and BCE]]. Use only one system within an article, and do not change from one system to the other without good reason. The abbreviations are written without periods, and with a [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking space]], as in {{xt|5&nbsp;BC}}. Omit AD or CE unless omitting it would cause ambiguity.\n\nMore information on all the above topics can be found at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Chronological items}}, including the handling of dates expressed in different calendars, and times corresponding to different time zones.\n\n===Current===\n{{Main|MOS:CURRENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:As of|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Relative time references}}\n\nTerms such as "current", "now", and "recent"{{efn|name=recent}} should be avoided. What is current today may not be tomorrow; situations change over time. Instead, use date- and time-specific text. To help keep information updated use {{tlx|As of}}, which will allow editors to catalog and update dated statements.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He is the current ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|As of March 2011, he is the ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|}\n\n==Numbers<span id="Spelling out numbers"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Numbers}}\n*Integers from zero to nine are spelled out in words. Integers greater than nine {{em|expressible in one or two words}} may be expressed either in numerals or in words. Other numbers are given in numerals or in forms such as {{xt|21{{nbsp}}million}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}}.\n*In general, in numbers with five or more digits to the left of the decimal point, use commas to group those digits. Numbers with four digits are at the editor\'s discretion: {{xt|12,345}}, but either {{xt|1,000}} or {{xt|1000}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Grouping of digits}}.\n*In general, use decimals rather than fractions for measurements, but fractions are sometimes used with [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[U.S. customary units|U.S. customary]] units. Keep articles internally consistent.\n*[[Scientific notation]] (e.g., {{xt|{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}}}) is preferred in scientific contexts. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}</nowiki></code>.\n*Write out "million" and "billion" on the first use. After that, unspaced "M" can be used for millions and "bn" for billions: {{xt|70M}} and {{xt|25bn}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}} for similar words.\n*Write {{xt|3%}}, {{xt|three percent}}, or {{xt|three per cent}}, but not {{!xt|3{{nbsp}}%}} (with a space) or {{!xt|three{{nbsp}}%}}. "Percent" is American usage, and "per cent" is British usage {{crossref|(see {{section link||National varieties of English}})}}. In ranges of percentages written with an en dash, write only a single percent sign: {{xt|3–14%}}.\n*Indicate uncertainties as e.g., {{xt|{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}}}. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}</nowiki></code>. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Uncertainty and rounding}} for other formats.\n\n==Currencies==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Currencies and monetary values}}\n*Use the full abbreviation on first use ({{xt|US$}} for the US dollar and {{xt|A$}} for the Australian dollar), {{em|unless the currency is already clear from context}}. For example, the government of the United States always spends money in American dollars, and never in Canadian or Australian dollars.\n*Use only one symbol with ranges, as in {{xt|$250–300}}.\n*In articles that are not specific to a country, express amounts of money in [[United States dollars]], [[euros]], or [[pounds sterling]]. Do not link the names or symbols of currencies that are commonly known to English-speakers ({{xt|$}}, {{xt|€}}, {{xt|£}}), unless there is a particular reason to do so; do not use potentially ambiguous currency symbols, unless the meaning is clear in the context.\n*In country-specific articles, use the currency of the country. On first occurrence, consider including conversion to US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling, at a rate appropriate to the context. For example, {{xt|Since 2001 the grant has been 10,000,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] (€1.0M as of August 2009)}}. Wording such as "approx." is not appropriate for simple rounding-off of the converted amount.\n*Generally, use the full name of a currency, and link it on its first appearance if English-speakers are likely to be unfamiliar with it ({{xt|52 [[Nepalese rupee]]s}}); subsequent occurrences can use the currency sign (just {{xt|88 Rs}}).\n*Most currency symbols are placed {{em|before}} the number, and unspaced {{nobr|({{xt|$123}} not {{!xt|$ 123}}).}}\n\n==Units of measurement==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Units of measurement}}\n*The main unit in which a quantity is expressed should generally be an [[International System of Units|SI]] unit or [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|non-SI unit officially accepted for use with the SI]]. However,\n**Scientific articles may also use specialist units appropriate for the branch of science in question.\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United States, the main unit is generally a U.S. customary unit ({{xt|22 pounds (10 kg)}}).\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United Kingdom, although the main unit is generally a metric unit ({{xt|10 kilograms (22 lb)}}), imperial units are still used as the main units in some contexts ({{xt|7 miles (11 km) by road}}).\n*Where English-speaking countries use different units for the same measurement, provide a conversion in parentheses. Examples: {{xt|the Mississippi River is {{convert|2320|mi|km|0}} long}}; {{xt|the Murray River is {{convert|2375|km|mi|0}} long}}. See {{tlx|convert}}.\n*In a direct quotation, always retain the source\'s units. Any conversion should follow in square brackets (or, an obscure use of units can be explained in the article text or a [[Wikipedia:Footnotes|footnote]]).\n*Where space is limited (such as tables, infoboxes, parenthetical notes, and mathematical formulas) unit symbols are preferred. In prose, unit names should be given in full if used only a few times but symbols may be used when a unit (especially one with a long name) is used repeatedly after spelling out the first use (e.g., {{xt|Up to 15 kilograms of filler is used for a batch of 250{{nbsp}}kg}}), except for unit names that are hardly ever spelled out ({{xt|°C}} rather than {{!xt|degrees Celsius}}).\n*Most unit names are not capitalized (see {{section link||National varieties of English}} for spelling differences).\n*Use "per" when writing out a unit, rather than a slash: {{xt|metre per second}}, not {{!xt|metre/second}}.\n*Units unfamiliar to general readers should be presented as a name–symbol pair on first use, linking the unit name ({{xt|Energies were originally 2.3 [[megaelectronvolt]]s (MeV), but were eventually 6{{nbsp}}MeV}}).\n*For ranges, see {{section link||En dashes: other uses}}, and MOS:NUM, at {{section link|nopage=y|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Date ranges|Percentages|Unit names and symbols|Formatting of monetary values}}.\n*Unit symbols are preceded by figures, not by spelled-out numbers. Values and unit symbols are separated by a [[non-breaking space]]. For example, {{xt|5&nbsp;min}}. The percent sign and units of degrees, minutes, and seconds {{em|for angles and coordinates}} are unspaced.\n\n==Common mathematical symbols==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMONMATH}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics}}\n*For a negative sign or subtraction operator, use a minus sign ({{xt|−}}, Unicode character U+2212 <small>MINUS SIGN</small>). Input by clicking on it in the insert box beneath the edit window or by typing <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n*For multiplication, use a multiplication sign ({{unichar|d7|MULTIPLICATION SIGN}}) or a dot ({{unichar|22c5|DOT OPERATOR}}), which are input by clicking on them in the edit toolbox under the edit window or by entering <code>&amp;times;</code> or <code>&amp;sdot;</code>. Care should be taken not to confuse the dot operator (in the "Math and logic" section of the edit toolbox) with an interpunct (in the "Insert" section of the edit toolbox) or a bullet. The letter {{xt|x}} should not be used to indicate multiplication, but it is used (unspaced) as the substitute for "by" in terms such as {{xt|[[4x4]]}}.\n*[[Exponentiation]] is indicated by a superscript, {{xt|\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup>}} (typed as <code><nowiki>\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup></nowiki></code>.\n*Do not use programming language notation outside computer program text. In most programming languages, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation are represented by the [[hyphen-minus]] <code>-</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code>, and either the [[caret]] <code>^</code> or the double asterisk <code>**</code> respectively; [[scientific notation]] is replaced by [[E notation]].\n*Symbols for [[binary operator]]s and [[binary relation|relations]] are usually spaced on both sides:\n**plus, minus, and plus-or-minus (as binary operators): {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|5&nbsp;−&nbsp;3}});\n**multiplication and division: {{xt|×}}, {{xt|÷}};\n**equals, does not equal, equals approximately: {{xt|{{=}}}}, {{xt|≠}}, {{xt|≈}};\n**is less than, is less than or equal to, is greater than, is greater than or equal to: {{xt|<}}, {{xt|≤}}, {{xt|>}}, {{xt|≥}}.\n*Symbols for [[unary operator]]s are closed-up to their operand:\n**positive, negative, and positive-or-negative signs: {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|−3}});\n**other unary operators, such as the exclamation mark as a [[factorial]] sign (as in {{xt|5!}}).\n*Variables are italicized, but digits and punctuation are not; only \'\'x\'\' and \'\'y\'\' are italicized in {{xt|2(5\'\'x\'\'&nbsp;+&nbsp;\'\'y\'\')<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*{{tlx|math}} can be used to style formulas to distinguish them from surrounding text.

Do not italicize words like "see".

In British English, such words are sometimes treated as singular, but more often treated as plural, according to context (but singular is not actually {{Em|incorrect}}). In North American English, these words are almost invariably treated as singular; the major exception is that when a sports team is referred to by its short name, plural verbs are commonly used, e.g. {{xt|the [[Miami Heat|Heat]] are playing the Lakers tonight}}.\n\nNames of towns and countries usually take singular verbs (even when grammatically plural: {{xt|the United States is in North America}}, {{xt|the Netherlands is also known as Holland}}), but exceptionally in British English, typically when used to refer to a sports team named after a town or country or when discussing actions of a government, plural is used. For example, in {{xt|[[England national football team|England]] are playing [[Germany national football team|Germany]] tomorrow}}, \'\'England\'\' refers to a [[Association football|football]] team; but in {{xt|England is in the Northern hemisphere}}, it refers to the country.

Do not {{em|tell}} readers that something is interesting, ironic, surprising, unexpected, amusing, coincidental, etc. Simply present sourced facts neutrally and let readers draw their own conclusions.

In the consideration of name changes of persons and organizations, focus on sources from the last few years. For broader English-language usage matters, about forty years is typical. While style guides with fewer than five years in print have not been in publication long enough to have had as much real-world impact as those from around 2000–2015 (on which MoS is primarily based), the corpora used for [[Google ngrams|Google {{var|n}}grams]] are updated through 2019, and we frequently [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#Some search engine tests|rely on]] what they indicate from the late 20th century and onward.}} reliable sources.

In summary:\n*Use gendered words only if they reflect the person\'s latest self-identification as reported in recent sources.\n*If the person is living and was not notable yet when a former name was in use, that name should not be included in any Wikipedia page, even in quotations, as a privacy matter. Exception: Do not expunge or replace names in source citations (whether as authors or mentioned in work titles).\n*Former names under which a living person was notable should be introduced with "born" or "formerly" in the lead sentence of their main biographical article. Name and gender matters should be explained at first appearance in that article, without overemphasis. In articles on works or other activities of such a person, use their current name by default, and give another name associated with that context in a parenthetical or footnote, only if they were notable under that name. In other articles, do not go into detail about such a person\'s name or gender except when directly relevant to the context.\n*Avoid confusing constructions by rewriting. Paraphrase, elide, or use square brackets to replace portions of quotations as needed to avoid confusion, former names, and mismatching gendered words.\n{{Crossref|printworthy=y|For examples and finer points, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Gender identity}}.}}\n\n===Non-English terms <span class="anchor" id="Foreign terms"></span> ===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NON-ENG|WP:!EN|MOS:FOREIGN}}\n{{See also|WP:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Other languages|WP:Manual of Style/Lead section#Foreign language|:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style (regional)|Help:Interlanguage links}}\n\n==== Terms without common usage in English <span class="anchor" id="No common usage in English"></span> ====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English language terms}}\n\nNon-English terms should be used sparingly. In general, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Foreign terms|use italics]] for phrases and words that are not current in English. This is best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template using the appropriate [[ISO language code]], e.g., {{tlx|lang|es|casa}}. There are alternatives to the {{tnull|lang}} template which also provide additional information about a non-English word or phrase, such as a link to the language name; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see [[:Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates]]}}. As Wikipedia does not apply italics to names of people, places, or organizations, the alternative template {{tlx|langr}} can be used to apply the language markup without italicizing.{{efn|This has the benefit of helping screen readers pronounce the name correctly. Such a proper name may be italicized when contrasting it with a conventional English form: {{xt|Munich ({{lang-de|München|link=no}})}}.}} Templates like {{tlx|lang}} automatically italicize text written using the Latin alphabet, so specifying italics is unnecessary. \n\nText written in non-Latin scripts such as Greek, Cyrillic, and Chinese should not be italicized or put in bold, as the difference in script is already sufficient to visually distinguish the text. Generally, any non-Latin text should include an appropriate romanization.\n\n====Terms with common usage in English====\n{{anchor|Common usage in English|reason=Old section name, surely has incoming links.}}\n[[Loanword]]s and borrowed phrases that have common usage in English{{snd}}{{xt|Gestapo}}, {{xt|samurai}}, {{xt|vice versa}}{{snd}}do not require italics.

If a particular romanization of the subject\'s name is [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names|most common]] in English ({{xt|Tchaikovsky}}, {{xt|Chiang Kai-shek}}), that form should be used. Otherwise, the romanization of names should adhere to a particular widely used system for the language in question ({{xt|Aleksandr Tymoczko}}, {{xt|Wang Yanhong}}). \n\nThe use of [[diacritic]]s in non-English words is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Use generally depends on whether they appear in reliable English-language sources, though with some additional constraints imposed by site guidelines. Provide [[Wikipedia:Redirect#Alternative names and languages|redirects]] from alternative forms that include or exclude diacritics.\n\nProper names in languages written using the [[Latin alphabet]] can include letters with diacritics, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and other characters that are not commonly used in contemporary English. Wikipedia normally retains these special characters, except where there is a well-established English spelling that replaces them with English standard letters. Examples:\n* The name of the article on Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] is spelt with the [[double acute accent]], and the alternative spellings \'\'Paul Erdos\'\' and \'\'Paul Erdös\'\' redirect to that article.\n* Similarly, the name of the article on the Nordic god [[Ægir]] is so spelt, with redirects from the ligature-free form [[Aegir]] and the Swedish spelling [[Ägir]].\n* However, the region of Spain named {{lang|es|Aragón}} in Spanish and {{lang|ca|Aragó}} in Catalan is given as [[Aragon]], without the accent, as this is the established English name. Non-English forms with diacritics appear in the article\'s lead section.\nUse of diacritics is determined on a topic-by-topic basis; a [[Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus|small group of editors]] cannot prohibit or require the use of diacritics within a given class of articles.{{efn|1=See the near-unanimous [[Special:PermanentLink/496631631#RfC:_Can_a_wikiproject_require_no-diacritics_names,_based_on_an_organisation\'s_rule_or_commonness_in_English_press?|RfC]], repeated [[Special:PermanentLink/664830645|deletion]] at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion]] of an anti-diacritics "wikiproject", the policy {{section link|Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus}}, and the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee]]\'s standardized [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Principles 2#Levels of consensus|\'\'statements of principles\'\' on such matters]].}}\n\nSpell a name consistently in the title and the text of an article. {{crossref|(Relevant policy: [[Wikipedia:Article titles]]; see also [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]].)}} For a non-English name, phrase, or word, adopt the spelling most commonly used in English-language [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable sources|reliable sources]], including but not limited to those already cited in the article.{{efn|name=GScholar|1=Reputable English-language encyclopedias and dictionaries in the aggregate are often helpful in [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Widely accepted name|determining the most widely accepted spelling]] of a place name, loanwords, etc. It may also help ([[Wikipedia:Google test|within limits]]) to compare search results from the [[Google Scholar]] journal index, for topics likely to be covered in peer-reviewed academic papers.}} For punctuation of compounded forms, see relevant guidelines in {{section link||Punctuation}}.\n\n[[Proper and common nouns|Proper name]]s in non-English languages should generally not be italicized, unless another reason applies; such as with [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles of works#FOREIGNTITLE|titles of major published works]], e.g., [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|{{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}]]; or when being compared to other names for the same subject in a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words-as-words]] manner, e.g., {{xt|\'\'\'Nuremberg\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Nürnberg}})}}.

Minimize the use of [[jargon]], and adequately explain its meaning when it is used. Overly technical material can be tagged with {{tlx|Technical}} or {{tlx|Technical-statement}}, so that it can be addressed by other editors. For topics that require a more technical approach, the creation of a separate introductory article (like [[Introduction to general relativity]]) may be a solution.\n\nExcessive \'\'wikilinking\'\' (linking within Wikipedia) can result from trying too hard to avoid putting explanations in parenthetical statements, like the one that appeared earlier in this sentence. Do not introduce specialized words simply to teach them to the reader when more widely understood alternatives will do. \n\nWhen the concepts underlying the jargon used in an article are too complex to explain concisely in a parenthetical, [[Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable#Write one level down|write one level down]]. For example, consider adding a brief background section with {{tlx|main}} tags pointing to articles with a fuller treatment of the prerequisite material.

These names often give rise to conflict, because the same places are called different things by different peoples speaking different languages. Many place names have a historical context that should be preserved, but common sense should prevail. There can be few places that have not been parts of more than one culture or have had only one name. As proper nouns, all such place names (but not terms for types of places) [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Place names|have major words capitalized]].\n\nA place should generally be referred to consistently by the same name as in the title of its article {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]])}}. An exception may be made when there is a widely accepted historical English name appropriate to the given context. In cases where such a historical name is used, it should be followed by the modern{{efn|name=recent}} name in round brackets (parentheses) on the first occurrence of the name in applicable sections of the article. This resembles linking; it should not be done to the detriment of style. On the other hand, it is probably better to provide such a variant too often than too rarely. If more than one historical name is applicable for a given context, the other names should be added after the modern English name, that is: "historical name (modern name, other historical names)".\n\nThis is an English-language encyclopedia, so established English names are preferred if they exist, and spellings in non-English alphabets should always be transcribed into the Roman alphabet. In general, other articles should refer to places by the names which are used in the articles on those places, according to the rules described at [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]]. If a different name is appropriate in a given historical or other context, then that may be used instead, although it is normal to follow the first occurrence of such a name with the standard modern name in parentheses.\n\nAt the start of an article, provide notable equivalent names from other languages, including transcriptions where necessary: \n:\'\'\'Cologne\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Köln|link=no}}, IPA: {{IPA|[kœln]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n:\'\'\'Mount Fuji\'\'\' ({{lang|ja|富士山}} {{translit|ja|Fuji-san}}, IPA: {{IPA|[ɸuʥisaɴ]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n\nNames in languages with no particular present-day or historical ties to the place in question (English excepted, of course) should {{em|not}} be listed as alternatives.\n\nAvoid anachronism. An article about [[Junípero Serra]] should say he lived in [[Alta California|Alta Mexico]], not in [[California]], because the latter entity did not yet exist in Serra\'s time. The Romans invaded [[Gaul]], not [[France]], and [[Thabo Mbeki]] was the president of the [[Republic of South Africa]], not of the [[Cape Colony]]. To be clear, you may sometimes need to mention the current name of the area (for example "in what is now France"), especially if no English name exists for that area in the relevant historical period.<section end="MOS:GEO" />\n\n==Media files==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Creation and usage of media files}}\n\n===Images===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IM}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Images}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Images|Wikipedia:Image use policy|Wikipedia:Picture tutorial}}\n\n*Each image should be inside the level{{nbs}}2 section to which it relates, within the section defined by the most recent <code>==Heading==</code> delimited by two equal signs, or at the top of the lead section.

See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Alternative text for images]].\n\n===Other media===\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Videos}}\nStyle guidelines for still images are generally also applicable to equivalent questions regarding the use of audio and video media.\n\n===Avoid using images to display text<span id="Avoid entering textual information as images"></span>===\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Text}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:TEXTASIMAGES}}\n\nTextual information should always be transmitted <em>as text</em>, rather than in an image. True text can be easily searched, selected, copied, and manipulated by readers; its presentation can also be adjusted using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]. These tasks are generally difficult or impossible with text presented in an image: images are slower to download, and generally cannot be searched or processed by [[screen reader]]s used by the visually impaired. Any important textual information in an image should be provided somewhere as text, generally either in the image\'s caption or alt text.\n\nFor entering textual information as audio, see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia]].\n\n===Captions===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:CAPTION}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Captions}}\n\nPhotographs and other graphics should have captions, unless they are unambiguous depictions of the subject of the article or when they are "self-captioning" images (such as reproductions of album or book covers). In a biography article no caption is necessary for a portrait of the subject pictured alone, but one might be used to give the year, the subject\'s age, or other circumstances of the portrait along with the name of the subject.\n\n====Formatting of captions====\n*Captions normally start with a capital letter.{{efn|name=Sentence case}}\n*Most captions are not complete sentences but merely [[sentence fragment]]s which should not end with a period. However, if any complete sentence occurs in a caption, then every sentence and every sentence fragment in that caption should end with a period.\n*The text of captions should not be specially formatted, except in ways that would apply if it occurred in the main text (e.g., italics for the Latin name of a species).\n*Captions should be succinct; more information can be included on its description page, or in the main text.\n*Captions for technical charts and diagrams may need to be substantially longer than usual; they should fully describe all elements of the image and indicate its significance.\n\n==Bulleted and numbered lists==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LISTBULLET|MOS:LISTNUMBERED}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists}}\n{{further information|Help:List}}\n*Do not use lists if a passage is read easily as plain paragraphs.\n*Use proper wiki markup- or template-based list code {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists]] and [[Help:List]])}}.\n*Do not leave blank lines between items in a bulleted or numbered list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the Wiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list.\n**Indents (such as this) are permitted if the elements are [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists#"Children" (i.e., indentation)|"child" items]].\n*Use numbers rather than bullets only if:\n**a need to refer to the elements by number may arise;\n**the sequence of the items is critical; or\n**the numbering has some independent meaning, for example in a listing of musical tracks.\n*Use the same grammatical form for all elements in a list, and do not mix sentences and sentence fragments as elements, for example when the elements are:\n**\'\'\'complete sentences\'\'\' – each one is formatted with sentence case (its first letter is capitalized) and a final period (full point);\n**\'\'\'sentence fragments\'\'\' – the list is typically introduced by an introductory fragment ending with a colon;\n**\'\'\'titles of works\'\'\' – they retain the original capitalization of the titles;\n**\'\'\'other elements\'\'\' – they are formatted consistently in either sentence case or lower case.\n\n==Links==\n===Wikilinks===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking}}\n{{See also|Help:Link}}\n\n\'\'\'Make [[Help:Link|links]] only where they are relevant and helpful in the context\'\'\': Excessive use of hyperlinks can be distracting and may slow the reader down. Redundant links (like the one in {{!xt|the tallest people on [[Earth]]}}) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that {{em|are}} worth pursuing should stand out clearly.\n\n\'\'\'Linking to sections\'\'\': A hash sign&nbsp;(<code>#</code>) followed by the appropriate heading will lead to a relevant part of a page. For example, <code><nowiki>[[Apostrophe#Use in non-English names]]</nowiki></code> links to a particular section of the article [[Apostrophe]].\n\n\'\'\'Initial capitalization\'\'\': Wikipedia\'s [[MediaWiki]] software does not require that wikilinks begin with an upper-case character. Capitalize the first letter only where this is naturally called for, or when specifically referring to the linked article by its name (see also related rule for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Uses of italics that are specific to Wikipedia|italics in cross-references]]): {{xt|[[Snake]]s are often [[venomous]], but [[lizard]]s only rarely {{crossreference|(see [[Poison]])}}.}}\n\n\'\'\'Check links\'\'\': Ensure the destination is the intended one; many dictionary words lead to disambiguation pages and not to complete or well-chosen articles.\n\n===External links===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:External links}}\n\nExternal links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an \'\'External links\'\' section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. The standard format is a primary heading, <code>==External links==</code>, followed by a bulleted list of links. Identify the link and briefly indicate its relevance to the article. For example:\n\n{{Block indent|{{plain list|\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]</syntaxhighlight>\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]</syntaxhighlight>\n}} }}\n\nThese will appear as:\n\n{{Block indent|\n*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]\n*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]\n}}\n\nWhere appropriate, use [[:Category:External link templates|external link templates]] such as {{tlx|Official website}} and {{tlx|URL}}.\n\nAdd external links with discretion; Wikipedia is [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files|not a link repository]].\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n===Keep markup simple===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:MARKUP|MOS:SIMPLIFY}}\n[[File:Keep it Simple.jpg|right|90px]]\nOther things being equal, keep [[Help:Wiki markup|markup]] simple. This makes wikitext easier to understand and edit, and the results seen by the reader more predictable. Use HTML and CSS markup sparingly. See: [[KISS principle]].\n\nIn general, wikitext formatting is considered easier to use than HTML and wikitext is preferred if there are equivalents; see [[Help:HTML in wikitext]]. [[Wikipedia:HTML 5#Obsolete elements and attributes|Obsolete elements and attributes]] should be updated or removed. There are many templates that allow HTML markup to be used without putting it in articles directly, such as {{tl|em}} (see [[MOS:EMPHASIS]]) and {{tl|strong}} (see [[MOS:BOLD]]).\n\nAn [[Character entity reference|HTML character entity]] is sometimes better than the equivalent Unicode character, which may be difficult to identify in edit mode; for example, <code>&amp;Alpha;</code> is explicit whereas <code>&Alpha;</code> (the upper-case form of Greek <code>α</code>) may be misidentified as the Latin <code>A</code>.\n{{further|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Best practice: wiki markup and CSS classes}}\n\n===Formatting issues===\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting}}\n\nModifications in font size, blank space, and color {{crossref|(see {{section link||Color coding}})}} are an issue for the Wikipedia site-wide [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheet]] and should be reserved for special cases only.\n\nTypically, the use of custom font styles:\n*reduces consistency, as the text no longer looks uniform;\n*reduces usability, as it may be impossible for people with custom style sheets (e.g. for accessibility reasons) to override it, and may clash with a different [[Skin (computing)|skin]] or inconvenience people with color blindness {{crossref|(see below)}}; and\n*causes disputes, as other editors may disagree aesthetically with the choice of style.\n\nSpecify font sizes {{em|relatively}} (for example with <code>font-size: 85%</code>) rather than {{em|absolutely}} (like <code>font-size: 8pt</code>). The resulting font size of any text should not drop below 85% of the page\'s default font size.\n\n====Color coding====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Color}}{{Shortcut|MOS:COLORCODING}}\n\nDo not use color {{em|alone}} to mark differences in text: they may be invisible to people with [[color blindness]] and useless in black-and-white printouts or displays.\n\nChoose colors such as [[maroon|<span style="background: white; color: maroon">maroon</span>]] and [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]] that are distinguishable by readers with the most common form of colorblindness, and {{em|additionally}} mark the differences with change of font or some other means ([[maroon|<span style="background: white; font-family: Georgia, serif; color: maroon; font face: Times New Roman">maroon and alternative font face</span>]], [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]]). Avoid low contrast between text and background colors. See also [[color coding]].\n\nEven for readers with unimpaired color vision, excessive background shading of table entries impedes readability and recognition of Wikilinks. Background color should be used only as a {{em|supplementary}} visual cue and should be subtle (consider using lighter, less-dominant [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] hues) rather than glaring.\n\n====Indentation<span class="anchor" id="INDENT"></span><span class="anchor" id="Indent"></span><span class="anchor" id="indenting"></span>====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:INDENT}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}}\n\nDo not use quotation templates to indent non-quotations. Various templates are available for indentation, including {{tlx|block indent}} to indent an entire block and {{tlx|in5}} to indent inline.\n\nDo not use <code>:</code> ([[description list]] markup) to indent text in articles, even though it is common on talk pages. It causes accessibility problems and outputs invalid HTML. {{Crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}} for alternatives.}}\n\n===Controlling line breaks<span id="Non-breaking spaces"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NBSP}}\n{{See also|Help:Line-break handling|Template:Spaces}}\n\nIt is sometimes desirable to force a text segment to appear entirely on a single line{{mdashb}}that is, to prevent a line break (line wrap) from occurring anywhere within it.\n*A \'\'\'[[non-breaking space]]\'\'\' (or \'\'\'hard space\'\'\') will never be used as a line-break point. Markup: for {{xt|19{{nbsp}}kg}}, code <code>19&amp;nbsp;kg</code> {{em|or}} <code>19{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>.\n*Or use {{tlx|nowrap}}, {{tlx|nobreak}}, or {{tlx|nobr}} (all equivalent). Markup: for {{xt|{{nobr|5° 24′ N}}}}, code {{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ N}}.\n\nIt is desirable to prevent line breaks where breaking across lines might be confusing or awkward. For example:\n{{columns list|colwidth=15em|\n*<code>17{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>\n*<code>AD{{t|nbsp}}565</code>\n*<code>2:50{{t|nbsp}}pm</code>\n*<code>£11{{t|nbsp}}billion</code>\n*<code>May{{t|nbsp}}2014</code>\n*{{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ 21″ N}}\n*<code>Boeing{{t|nbsp}}747</code>\n*<code>123{{t|nbsp}}Elm Street</code>\n*<code>World War{{t|nbsp}}II</code>\n*<code>Pope Paul{{t|nbsp}}VI</code>\n*<code><nowiki>\'\'</nowiki>E.{{t|nbsp}}coli<nowiki>\'\'</nowiki></code>\n}}\n\nWhether a non-breaking space is appropriate depends on context: whereas it is appropriate to use <code>12{{t|nbsp}}MB</code> in prose, it may be counterproductive in a table (where an unattractive break may be acceptable to conserve precious horizontal space) and unnecessary in a short parameter value in an infobox (where a break would never occur anyway).\n\nA line break may occur at a \'\'\'thin space\'\'\' (<code>&amp;thinsp;</code>, or {{tlx|thinsp}}), which is sometimes used to correct too-close placement of adjacent characters. To prevent this, consider using {{tlx|nobr}}.\n\nInsert non-breaking and thin spaces as [[named character reference]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;thinsp;</code>), or as templates that generate these ({{tlx|nbsp}}, {{tlx|thinsp}}), and never by entering them directly into the edit window from the keyboard{{snd}}they are visually indistinguishable from regular spaces, and later editors will be unable to see what they are. Inside wikilinks, a construction such as {{nobr|<code><nowiki>[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]</nowiki></code>}} works but {{nobr|<code>[[World War{{t|nbsp}}II]]</code>}} doesn\'t.\n\n===Scrolling lists and collapsible content===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SCROLL|MOS:COLLAPSE|MOS:DONTHIDE}}\n{{Redirect|WP:COLLAPSE|the guideline on collapsing off-topic talk page discussions|WP:TALKOFFTOPIC}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support}}\n\nElements that can selectively display or hide content can interfere with the ability of readers to access said content. These mechanisms include [[Help:Scrolling list|scrolling list]]s, and templates like {{tlx|collapse}} that can be toggled between collapsed and uncollapsed states using a {{bracket|{{midsize|hide{{\\}}show}}}} button. These mechanisms should not be used to conceal "[[Wikipedia:Spoiler|spoiler]]" information. Templates should generally [[Wikipedia:Template namespace#Guidelines|not be used to store article text]] at all, as it interferes with editors\' ability to find and edit it. Moreover, content in an article should <em>never</em> be collapsed by default. This applies equally to content in [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables|tables]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists|embedded lists]], [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Image galleries|image galleries]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Captions|image captions]].\n\nIf such mechanisms are used, care must be taken to ensure the content remains accessible for all users, including [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support|those with limited CSS or JavaScript support]]. What\'s more, careless use of collapsible templates will impact accessibility for the <em>clear majority</em> of readers (more than 60%) who use the [[Help:Mobile access|mobile version of the site]],{{efn|1=See [[Template:Navbox visibility]].}} which does not support collapsing and will either completely uncollapse or completely hide the content within the template. The usability of the mobile site is  easy to test with the "Mobile view" link at the bottom of each page.{{efn|1=The "Mobile sidebar preview" tool near the bottom of [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets]] permits live preview. The "Mobile view" page-bottom feature shows the article only as it currently exists; if using that, and considering a change that could have mobile accessibility implications, please save the change first in a [[Wikipedia:User pages#Subpages|user sandbox]] and test the mobile version of that. The mobile website can also be accessed by changing a page\'s URL from <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> to <code>en.m.wikipedia.org</code>. Note that the "desktop" version of the site being viewed on a mobile device is distinct from the <em>mobile version</em> of the site. However, checking the desktop site on a mobile device may be a worthwhile for some broader accessibility matters, especially on tablets, which do not always use the mobile version of Wikipedia.}}\n\nWhen hiding content is desired, it must be done using the <code>collapsible</code> parameter of relevant templates, or manually-added CSS classes <code>mw-collapsed</code>, and <code>autocollapse</code> (see [[Help:Collapsing]]). Other methods of hiding content should not be used, as they may render content inaccessible to many users, such as those browsing Wikipedia with [[JavaScript]] disabled, browsing the mobile version,{{efn|Collapsing content using those classes does not work in the mobile version, where such content is simply always shown. However, applying, or using a template that applies, any of the following CSS classes will cause the affected content to be inaccessible to mobile users, and this list may not be exhaustive: <code>navbox</code>, <code>mbox-image</code>, <code>vertical-navbox</code>, <code>nomobile</code> are from <code>[https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-mediawiki-config/blob/master/wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php#L17056 wgMFRemovableClasses]</code>. No top icons are displayed, so <code>topicon</code> is missing.}} or using proxy services such as [[Google Web Light]].\n\nCollapsed or auto-collapsing \'\'cells\'\' or \'\'sections\'\' may be used with tables if they simply repeat information covered in the main text (or are purely supplementary, e.g., several past years of statistics in collapsed tables for comparison with a table of uncollapsed current stats). Auto-collapsing is often a feature of [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates#Navigation templates|navboxes]]. A few [[Wikipedia:Infobox|infoboxes]] also use pre-collapsed sections for infrequently accessed details. If information in a list, infobox, or other non-navigational content seems extraneous or trivial enough to inspire pre-collapsing it, consider raising a discussion on the article (or template) talk page about whether it should be [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|included at all]]. If the information is important and the concern is article density or length, consider [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Body sections|dividing the article into more sections]], integrating [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trivia sections|unnecessarily list-formatted information]] into the article prose, or [[Wikipedia:Summary style|splitting the article]].\n\n===Invisible comments===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMENT}}\n{{redirect|WP:COMMENT|the expression of personal opinions in articles|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought}}\n{{for|invisible control characters|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Private Use Area and invisible formatting characters}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Hidden text}}\n\nEditors use "invisible" comments{{snd}}not shown in the rendered page seen by readers of the article, but visible in the source editing mode when an editor opens the article for editing{{snd}}to communicate with one another.\n\nInvisible comments are useful for alerting other editors to issues such as common mistakes that regularly occur in the article, a section title\'s being the target of an incoming link, or pointing to a discussion that established a consensus relating to the article. They should not be used to instruct other editors not to perform certain edits, which could be perceived as expressing a form of [[WP:OWN|ownership]] over an article, although where existing local consensus is against making an edit they may usefully draw the editor\'s attention to that. Avoid adding too many invisible comments because they can clutter the wiki source for other editors. Check that your invisible comment does not change the formatting, for example by introducing unwanted white space in the rendered page.\n\nTo leave an invisible comment, enclose the text you intend to be read only by editors between <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>. For example:\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;If you change this section title, also change the links to it on the pages&nbsp;...&nbsp;|wrap=yes}} {{small|(there are bots which can do this, see [[MOS:RENAMESECTION]])}}\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;When adding table entries, remember to update the total given in the text.&nbsp;|wrap=yes}}\nThis notation can be inserted with a single click in [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]], just under the edit pane in edit mode.\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation}}\n\n\'\'\'Pronunciation\'\'\' in Wikipedia is indicated in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). In most situations, for ease of understanding by the majority of readers and across variants of the language, [[Phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|quite broad]] IPA transcriptions are best for English pronunciations. See [[Help:IPA/English]] and [[Help:IPA]] (general) for keys, and {{tlx|IPA}} for templates that link to these keys. For English pronunciations, [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|pronunciation respellings]] may be used {{em|in addition to}} the IPA.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wikipedia:Editing policy|Editing policy]] –

That advanced search does not search [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], so also check the article\'s [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] page for redirects to the old section title. If there are only a small number of links to the old section title, it may be better to just update them. }} create an [[Help:Anchor|anchor]] with that title to ensure that these still work. Similarly, when linking to a section, leave an invisible comment at the heading of the target section, naming the linking articles, so that if the heading is later altered these can be fixed. For (a combined) example:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code><nowiki>==Implications{{subst:</nowiki>[[Template:Anchor|Anchor]]<nowiki>|Consequences}}==</nowiki><br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\nwhich will be saved in the article as:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code>==Implications{{code|1={{Anchor|Consequences}}}}==<br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\n\nThe advantage of using <code><nowiki>{{subst:Anchor}}</nowiki></code>, or simply inserting the <code><nowiki><span></nowiki></code> tags directly, is that when edits are made to the section in the future, the anchor will not be included in page history entries as part of the section name. When <code><nowiki>{{Anchor}}</nowiki></code> is used directly, that undesirable behavior \'\'does\'\' occur. Note: if electing to insert the span directly, do not abbreviate it by using a self-closing tag, as in <code><nowiki>==Implications<span id="Consequences" />==</nowiki></code>, since in HTML5 that XML-style syntax is valid only for certain tags, such as {{nowrap |<code>&lt;br /></code>}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T134423 |title=T134423 Deprecate nonstandard behavior of self-closed HTML tags in wikitext. |website=phabricator.wikimedia.org |access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Avoiding broken section links}} for further discussion.\n\n====Heading-like material====\nThe above guidance about sentence case, redundancy, images, and questions also applies to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|headers of tables]] (and of table columns and rows). However, table headings can incorporate citations and may begin with, or be, numbers. Unlike page headings, table headers do not automatically generate link anchors. Aside from sentence case in glossaries, the heading advice also applies to the \'\'term\'\' entries in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#DLIST|description lists]]. If using [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Glossaries#Linking|template-structured glossaries]], terms will automatically have link anchors, but will not otherwise. Citations for description-list content go in the \'\'term\'\' or \'\'definition\'\' element, as needed.\n\n==National varieties of English==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ENGVAR}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Article titles#National varieties of English|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Spelling}}\n\nNational varieties of English (for example, [[American English]] or [[British English]]) differ in vocabulary (\'\'elevator\'\' vs. \'\'lift\'\'{{hairspace}}), spelling (\'\'center\'\' vs. \'\'centre\'\'), and occasionally grammar {{crossref|(see {{section link||Plurals}}, below)}}. Articles such as [[English plurals]] and [[Comparison of American and British English]] provide information about such differences. The English Wikipedia prefers no national variety over others.\n\nAn article\'s date formatting ({{xt|{{#time: F j, Y}}}} vs. {{xt|{{#time: j F Y}}}}) is also related to national varieties of English{{snd}}see [[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] and especially [[MOS:DATETIES]] and [[MOS:DATEVAR]].\n\n===Consistency within articles<span class="anchor" id="Internal consistency"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ARTCON|MOS:CONSISTENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Consistency}}\nThe conventions of a particular variety of English should be followed consistently within a given article. Exceptions include:\n*\'\'\'Quotations\'\'\' and \'\'\'titles of works\'\'\' (such as books, films, and music) should be given as they appear in sources. However, there are certain situations where this principle is not followed in order to maintain a level of typographic conformity across the encyclopedia: see {{section link||Typographic conformity}}.\n*\'\'\'Proper names\'\'\' use the subject\'s own spelling, e.g., {{xt|joint project of the United States Department of Defense and the Australian Defence Force}}; {{xt|International Labour Organization}}<!--This example is here because it uses -our and -ization at the same time; it is Oxford spelling.-->;\n*For articles about chemistry-related topics, the international standard spellings {{xt|aluminium}}, {{xt|sulfur}}, {{xt|caesium}} (and derivative terms) should be used regardless of the variety of English otherwise employed in the article. See {{section link|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)|Element names}}.\n\n===Opportunities for commonality===\n{{shortcut|MOS:COMMONALITY}}\n\nFor an international encyclopedia, using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable.\n*Use universally accepted terms rather than those less widely distributed, especially in titles. For example, [[Glasses|{{xt|glasses}}]] is preferred to the national varieties {{!xt|spectacles}} ([[British English]]) and {{!xt|eyeglasses}} ([[American English]]); [[Ten million|{{xt|ten million}}]] is preferable to [[crore|{{!xt|one crore}}]] ([[Indian English]]).\n*If a variant spelling appears in a title, make a [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirect]] page to accommodate the others, as with [[artefact]] and [[artifact]], so that all variants can be used in searches and linking.\n*Terms that differ between varieties of English, or that have divergent meanings, may be [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|glossed]] to prevent confusion, for example, {{xt|the trunk (American English) or boot (British English) of a car&nbsp;...}}.\n*Use a commonly understood word or phrase in preference to one that has a different meaning because of national differences (rather than {{!xt|alternate}}, use {{xt|alternative}} or {{xt|alternating}}, as appropriate), except in technical contexts where such substitution would be inappropriate ({{xt|alternate leaves}}; {{xt|alternate law}}).\n*When more than one variant spelling exists within a national variety of English, the most commonly used current variant should usually be preferred, except where the less common spelling has a specific usage in a specialized context, e.g., \'\'connexion\'\' in [[Connexionalism|Methodist connexionalism]].\n\n{{crossref|printworthy=y|For assistance with specific terms, see {{section link|Comparison of American and British English|Vocabulary}}, and [[American and British English spelling differences]]; most dictionaries also indicate regional terms.}}\n\n===Strong national ties to a topic===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:TIES}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Strong national ties to a topic|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Unit choice and order}}\n\nAn article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the (formal, not colloquial) English of that nation. For example:\n<!--\nPlease DO NOT add more examples here. This is not a list of English dialects.\nENGVAR is concerned with English varieties that exist in a codified, formal written register with their own style guides.\n-->\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Afrikaners]] ([[South African English]])\n*[[American Civil War]] ([[American English]])\n*[[Australian Defence Force]] ([[Australian English]])\n*[[Christchurch]] ([[New Zealand English]])\n*[[Dublin]] ([[Hiberno-English]])\n*[[Great Fire of London]] ([[British English]])\n*[[Lagos]] ([[Nigerian English]])\n*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] ([[Pakistani English]])\n*[[Mumbai]] ([[Indian English]])\n*[[Vancouver]] ([[Canadian English]])\n*[[Wanchai Tower]] ([[Hong Kong English]])\n}}\n\nFor topics with strong ties to [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries and other [[British Empire|former British territories]], use [[Commonwealth English]] orthography, largely indistinguishable from British English in encyclopedic writing (excepting Canada, which uses [[Canadian English#Spelling|a different orthography]]).\n\n===Retaining the existing variety===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:RETAIN}}\n{{See also|#Retaining existing styles|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Retaining the existing format}}\n{{redirect|WP:RETAIN|the general editing policy|WP:PRESERVE|the title policy|WP:TITLEVAR}}\n\nWhen an English variety\'s [[#Consistency within articles|consistent usage]] has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary. With few exceptions (e.g., when a topic has [[#Strong national ties to a topic|strong national ties]] or the change reduces ambiguity), there is no valid reason for changing from one acceptable option to another.\n\n{{anchor|FPSR|FMC}}When no English variety has been established and discussion does not resolve the issue, use the variety found in the first post-[[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]] revision that introduced an identifiable variety. The established variety in a given article can be documented by placing the appropriate [[:Category:Varieties of English templates|variety of English template]] on its talk page.\n\nAn article should not be edited or renamed simply to switch from one variety of English to another. {{tlxs|uw-engvar}} may be placed on an editor\'s talk page to explain this.\n\n==Capital letters==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters}}\n\nWikipedia article titles and section headings use sentence case, not title case; see [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] and {{section link||Section headings}}. For capitalization of list items, see {{section link||Bulleted and numbered lists}}. Other points concerning capitalization are summarized below. Full information can be found at [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters]]. The central point is that Wikipedia does not capitalize something unless it is consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].\n\n===Capitalization of \'\'The\'\'===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of The}}\n\nGenerally, do not capitalize the word \'\'the\'\' in mid-sentence: {{xt|throughout the United Kingdom}}, not {{!xt|throughout The United Kingdom}}. Conventional exceptions include certain proper names ({{xt|he visited The Hague}}) and most titles of creative works ({{xt|Tolkien wrote \'\'The Lord of the Rings\'\'}}{{snd}}but be aware that \'\'the\'\' may not be part of the title itself, e.g., {{xt|Homer composed the \'\'Odyssey\'\'}}).\n\nThere are special considerations for: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Music#Names (definite article)|band names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Institutions|institution names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#NICKNAMETHE|nicknames]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Indefinite and definite articles|titles of works]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks#TMTHE|trademarks]].\n\n===Titles of works<span id="Capitalization-Titles"></span>===\n{{main|WP:Manual of Style/Titles of works}}\n\nThe English-language titles of compositions (books and other print works, songs and other audio works, films and other visual media works, paintings and other artworks, etc.) are given in {{em|[[title case]]}}, in which every word is given an initial capital except for certain less important words (as detailed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters|Composition titles}}). The first and last words in an English-language title are always capitalized.\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'An Eye for an Eye\'\'}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'Worth the Fighting For\'\'}}\n\nCapitalization in non-English language titles varies, even over time within the same language; generally, retain the style of the original for modern works, and follow the usage in current{{efn|name=recent}} English-language reliable sources for historical works. When written in the Latin alphabet, many of these items should also be in [[#Italics|italics]], or enclosed in [[#Names and titles|quotation marks]].\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|"{{lang|de|italics=no|Hymnus an den heiligen Geist}}"}}\n\n===Titles of people===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Titles of people}}\n*\'\'\'In generic use\'\'\', use lower case for words such as \'\'president\'\', \'\'king\'\', and \'\'emperor\'\' ({{xt|De Gaulle was a French president}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was a French king}}; {{xt|Three prime ministers attended the conference}}).\n*\'\'\'Directly before the person\'s name\'\'\', such words begin with a capital letter ({{xt|President Obama}}, not {{!xt|president Obama}}). Standard or commonly used names of an office are treated as proper names ({{xt|David Cameron was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom}}; {{xt|Hirohito was Emperor of Japan}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}}). Royal styles take capitals ({{xt|Her Majesty}}; {{xt|His Highness}}); exceptions may apply for particular offices.\n\n===Religions, deities, philosophies, doctrines===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Religions, deities, philosophies, doctrines, and their adherents}}\n{{see|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Religion}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Religious texts}}\n*\'\'\'Religions, sects, and churches\'\'\' and their followers (in noun or adjective form) start with a capital letter. Generally, "the" is not capitalized before such names ({{xt|the Unitarians}}, not {{!xt|The Unitarians}}).\n*\'\'\'[[Religious text]]s\'\'\' are capitalized, but often not italicized ({{xt|the Bhagavad Gita}}, {{xt|the Quran}}, {{xt|the Talmud}}, {{xt|the Granth Sahib}}, {{xt|the Bible}}). Do not capitalize "the" when using it in this way. Some derived adjectives are capitalized by convention, and some are not ({{xt|biblical}}, but {{xt|Quranic}}); if unsure, check a dictionary.\n*\'\'\'[[Honorific]]s for deities\'\'\', including proper names and titles, start with a capital letter ({{xt|God}}, {{xt|Allah}}, {{xt|the Lord}}, {{xt|the Supreme Being}}, {{xt|the Great Spirit}}, {{xt|the Horned One}}, {{xt|Bhagavan}}). Do not capitalize "the" in such cases or when referring to major religious figures or characters from mythology ({{xt|the Prophet}}, {{xt|the Messiah}}, {{xt|the Virgin}}). Common nouns for deities and religious figures are not capitalized ({{xt|many gods}}; {{xt|the god Woden}}; {{xt|saints and prophets}}).\n*\'\'\'Pronouns for figures of veneration or worship\'\'\' are not capitalized, even if capitalized in a religion\'s scriptures ({{xt|God and his will}}).\n*\'\'\'Broad categories of mythical or legendary beings\'\'\' start with lower-case letters ({{xt|elf}}, {{xt|fairy}}, {{xt|nymph}}, {{xt|unicorn}}, {{xt|angel}}), although in works of fantasy, such as the novels of [[J.

Italicize but do not capitalize taxonomic ranks at the level of species and below: {{xt|\'\'Berberis darwinii\'\'}}, {{xt|\'\'Erithacus rubecula superbus\'\'}}, {{xt|\'\'Acacia coriacea\'\' subsp. \'\'sericophylla\'\'}}; no exception is made for proper names forming part of scientific names. Higher taxa (order, family, etc.) are capitalized in Latin ({{xt|Carnivora}}, {{xt|Felidae}}) but not in their English equivalents ({{xt|carnivorans}}, {{xt|felids}}); they are not italicized in either form, except for viruses, where all names accepted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] are italicized ({{xt|\'\'Retroviridae\'\'}}).\n\n\'\'\'[[Cultivar]]\'\'\' and \'\'\'[[cultivar group]]\'\'\' names of plants are not italicized, and are capitalized (including the word \'\'Group\'\' in the name); cultivar names appear within single quotes ({{xt|\'\'Malus domestica\'\' \'Red Delicious\'}}), while cultivar groups do not ({{xt|\'\'Cynara cardunculus\'\' Scolymus Group}}).\n\n\'\'\'English [[Common name|vernacular ("common") names]]\'\'\' are given in lower case in article prose ([[Plains zebra|{{xt|plains zebra}}]]<!-- animal species -->, [[Mountain maple|{{xt|mountain&nbsp;maple}}]]<!-- plant species -->, and [[Southwestern red-tailed hawk|{{xt|southwestern red-tailed hawk}}]]<!-- bird subspecies -->) and in sentence case at the start of sentences and in other places where the first letter of the first word is capitalized.{{efn|name=Sentence case}} They are additionally capitalized where they contain proper names: [[Przewalski\'s horse|{{xt|Przewalski\'s&nbsp;horse}}]]<!-- eponym -->, [[California condor|{{xt|California&nbsp;condor}}]]<!-- typical geonym -->, and [[Fair-maid-of-France|{{xt|fair-maid-of-France}}]]<!-- unusual but important illustrative case -->.

"Standardized breed" lacks a perfectly clear meaning, but does encompass any breed subject to the [[breed standard]] or [[studbook]] of a notable breeder/fancier organization. Various other groupings of domesticated animals are not standardized breeds: ancient historical varieties, breed groups, feral populations, landraces, and [[crossbreed]]s or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] that no major organizations recognize as breeds. Many often are not [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] anyway.}} Examples: [[German Shepherd|{{xt|German Shepherd}}]], [[Russian White goat|{{xt|Russian White goat}}]], [[Berlin Short-faced Tumbler|{{xt|Berlin Short-faced Tumbler}}]]. As with plant cultivars, this applies whether or not the included noun is a proper name, in contrast to how vernacular names of species are written. However, unlike cultivars, breeds are never put in single quotation marks, and their names are never part of a scientific name. A species term appended at the end for disambiguation ("cat", "hound", "horse", "swine", etc.) should not be capitalized, unless it is a part of the breed name itself and is consistently presented that way in the breed standards (rare cases include [[Norwegian Forest Cat|{{xt|Norwegian Forest Cat}}]] and [[American Quarter Horse|{{xt|American Quarter Horse}}]]).\n\nCreate [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]] from alternative capitalization and spelling forms of article titles, and from alternative names, e.g., [[Adélie Penguin]], [[Adelie penguin]], [[Adelie Penguin]] and \'\'[[Pygoscelis adeliae]]\'\' should all redirect to [[Adélie penguin]].\n\n===Celestial bodies===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Celestial bodies}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (astronomical objects)}}\nThe words \'\'sun\'\', \'\'earth\'\', \'\'moon\'\' and \'\'solar system\'\' do not take capitals in general use ({{xt|The sun was over the mountain top}}; {{xt|The tribal people thought of the whole earth as their home}}). They are capitalized when the entity is personified ({{xt|Sol Invictus (\'Unconquered Sun\') was the Roman sun god}}) or when used as the name of a specific body in a scientific or astronomical context ({{xt|The Moon orbits the Earth}}; but {{xt|Io is a moon of Jupiter}}).\n\nNames of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, stars, constellations, and galaxies are proper names, and therefore capitalized ({{xt|The planet Mars is in the constellation Gemini, near the star Pollux}}). The first letter of every word in such a name is capitalized ({{xt|Alpha Centauri}} and not {{!xt|Alpha centauri}}; {{xt|Milky Way}}, not {{!xt|Milky way}}). Words such as \'\'comet\'\' and \'\'galaxy\'\' should be capitalized when they form part of a proper name, but not when they are used as a generic term ({{xt|Halley\'s Comet is the most famous of the comets}}; {{xt|The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy}}).\n\n===Compass points<span class="anchor" id="Compass"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Compass points}}\n\nDo not capitalize \'\'\'directions\'\'\' such as \'\'north\'\', or their related forms ({{xt|We took the northern road}}), except where they are parts of proper names ({{xt|Great North Road}}, {{xt|Great Western Drive}}, {{xt|South Pole}}).\n\nCapitalize \'\'\'names of regions\'\'\' if they have attained proper-name status, including informal conventional names ({{xt|Southern California}}; {{xt|the Western Desert}}), and derived terms for people (e.g., a \'\'Southerner\'\' as someone from the [[Southern United States]]). Do not capitalize descriptive names for regions that have not attained the status of proper names, such as {{xt|southern Poland}}.\n\nComposite directions may or may not be hyphenated, depending on the [[#National varieties of English|variety of English adopted]] in the article. {{xt|Southeast Asia}} and {{xt|northwest}} are more common in American English; but {{xt|South-East Asia}} and {{xt|north-west}} in British English. In cases such as {{xt|north–south dialogue}} and {{xt|east–west orientation}}, use an en dash; see {{section link||En dashes: other uses}}.\n\n===Proper names versus generic terms<span id="Institutions"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Institutions|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of \'\'The\'\'}}\n\nCapitalize names of particular institutions ({{xt|the founding of the University of Delhi}};{{nbsp}} {{xt|the history of Stanford University}}) but not generic words for institutions ({{xt|the high school is near the university}}). Do not capitalize \'\'the\'\' at the start of an institution\'s name, regardless of the institution\'s preferred style. There are rare exceptions, when a leading \'\'The\'\' is represented by a \'\'T\'\' in the organization\'s acronym: {{xt|The International Cat Association (TICA)}}.\n\nTreat political or geographic units similarly: {{xt|The city has a population of 55,000}};{{nbsp}} {{xt|The two towns merged to become the City of Smithville}}. Do not mimic the style of local newspapers which refer to their municipality as \'\'the City\'\' or \'\'The City\'\'; an exception is the [[City of London]], referred to as {{xt|the City}} in a context that already makes the subject clear, as distinct from [[London]] and [[Greater London]]. When in doubt, use the full name for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]] reasons; users of text-to-speech systems usually cannot hear a difference between \'\'city\'\' and \'\'City\'\'.\n\n==Ligatures==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)#Modified letters}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LIG|MOS:LIGATURE}}\n\n[[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] should be used in languages in which they are standard (hence {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'œil\'\'}} is preferable to {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'oeil\'\'}}) but not in English ({{xt|encyclopedia}} or {{xt|encyclopaedia}}, not {{!xt|encyclopædia}}), except in proper names ({{xt|Æthelstan}}, not {{!xt|Aethelstan}}).\n\n==Abbreviations<span class="anchor" id="Acronyms and abbreviations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Acronyms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Initialisms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Shortenings"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Initials}}\n\nAbbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. In strict analysis, they are distinct from [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], which use an [[apostrophe]] (e.g., \'\'won\'t\'\', see {{Section link||Contractions}}), and [[initialism]]s. An initialism is formed from some or all of the initial letters of words in a phrase. Below, references to abbreviations should be taken to include acronyms, and the term \'\'acronym\'\' to apply also to initialisms.\n\n===Write first occurrences in full===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:1STOCC|MOS:1STABBR}}\n\nWhen an abbreviation will be used in an article, first introduce it using the full expression:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|an early local area network (LAN) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC){{nbsp}}... DEC\'s later LAN products were{{nbsp}}...}}}}\n\nDo not use capitals in the full version merely because capitals are used in the abbreviation: {{!xt|an early Local Area Network (LAN)}}.\n\nExcept in special circumstances, common abbreviations (such as {{xt|PhD}}, {{xt|DNA}}, {{xt|USSR}}) need not be expanded even on first use.\n\n===Plural forms===\nPluralize [[acronyms]] by adding \'\'-s\'\' or \'\'-es\'\': {{xt|Three CD-ROMs and two BIOSes were released}}. Do not [[Apostrophe#Abbreviations|use apostrophes to form plurals]]: {{!xt|Three CD-ROM\'s and two BIOS\'s were released}}.\n\n===Punctuation and spacing<span class="anchor" id="Periods (full stops) and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="Full stops and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="op.cit."></span>===\nAn abbreviation may or may not be terminated with a full point (also called a \'\'period\'\' or \'\'full stop\'\'). A consistent style should be maintained within an article. North American usage is typically to end all abbreviations with a period/point ({{xt|Dr. Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St.}}) but in common British and Australian usage, no period/point is used if the abbreviation (contraction) ends in the last letter of the unabbreviated form ({{xt|Dr Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St}}) unless confusion could result. This is also common practice in scientific writing. Regardless of punctuation, words that are abbreviated to more than one letter are spaced ({{xt|op.&nbsp;cit.}} not {{!xt|op.cit.}} or {{!xt|opcit}}). There are some exceptions: {{xt|PhD}} {{crossref|(see above)}} for "Philosophiae Doctor"; {{xt|BVetMed}} for "Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine". In most situations, Wikipedia uses no such punctuation inside acronyms and initialisms: {{xt|GDP}}, not {{!xt|G.D.P.}}\n\n===US and U.S.<span class="anchor" id="US"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S."></span><span class="anchor" id="USA"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S.A."></span>===\n{{redirect|MOS:US|the use of the word "us"|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#First-person pronouns}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:US|MOS:USA|MOS:NOTUSA}}\n{{xt|US}} is a commonly used abbreviation for {{xt|United States}}, although {{xtn|U.S.}} – with periods and without a space – remains common in North American publications, including in news journalism.  Multiple American style guides, including \'\'[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]\'\' (since 2010), now deprecate "U.S." and recommend "US".\n\nFor [[#Opportunities for commonality|commonality]] reasons, use {{xt|US}} by default when abbreviating, but [[#Retaining existing styles|retain]] {{xtn|U.S.}} in American or Canadian English articles in which it is already established, unless there is a good reason to change it. Because use of periods for abbreviations and acronyms should be consistent within any given article, use {{xt|US}} in an article with other country abbreviations, and especially avoid constructions like {{!xt|the U.S. and the UK}}. In longer abbreviations that incorporate the country\'s initials ({{xt|USN}}, {{xt|USAF}}), never use periods. When the United States is mentioned with one or more other countries in the same sentence, {{xt|US}} (or {{xtn|U.S.}}) may be too informal, especially at the first mention or as a noun instead of an adjective ({{xt|France and the United States}}, not {{!xt|France and the US}}). Do not use the spaced {{!xt|U.&nbsp;S.}} or the archaic {{!xt|U.S.&nbsp;of&nbsp;A.}}, except when quoting. Do not use {{!xt|U.S.A.}} or {{!xt|USA}} except in a quotation, as part of a proper name ({{xt|Team USA}}), or in certain technical and formal uses (e.g., the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]], [[FIFA country codes|FIFA]], and [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country codes]]).\n\n===Circa===\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Uncertain, incomplete, or approximate dates}} for examples.}}\n\nTo indicate \'\'approximately\'\', the use of {{tlx|circa}}, showing as {{circa}}, is preferred over circa, c., ca., or approx.\n\n===Avoid unwarranted use===\n<span class="anchor" id="unwarranted abbreviations"></span>\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Units of measurement}} for when to abbreviate units of measurement.}}\n\nAvoid abbreviations when they might confuse the reader, interrupt the flow, or appear informal. For example:\n*Do not use {{!xt|approx.}} for {{xt|approximate(ly)}} except in an infobox or table (in which case use {{tlx|abbr|approx.|approximately}} at first occurrence: {{xt|{{abbr|approx.|approximately}}}}).\n*Do not use the legalism {{!xt|Smith J}} for {{xt|Justice Smith}}. <!-- this might be better in [[WP:JARGON]] -->\n\n===Do not invent===\nAvoid devising [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary#Neologisms|new abbreviations]], especially acronyms. For example, {{xtn|World Union of Billiards}} is good as a {{em|translation}} of {{xt|[[Union Mondiale de Billard]]}}, but neither it nor the reduction {{!xt|WUB}} is used by the organization or by independent sources; use the original name and its official abbreviation, {{xt|UMB}}.\n\nIf it is necessary to abbreviate in a tight space, such as a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|column header in a table]], use widely recognized abbreviations. For example, for {{xt|New Zealand gross national product}}, use {{xt|NZ}} and {{xt|GNP}}, with a link if the term has not already been written out in the article: {{xt|NZ&nbsp;[[Measures of national income and output|GNP]]}}. Do not make up initialisms such as {{!xt|NZGNP}}.\n\n===HTML tags and templates===\nEither {{tag|abbr|o}} or {{tlx|abbr}} can be used for abbreviations and acronyms: {{tag|abbr|params=title="World Health Organization"|content=WHO|wrap=yes}} or {{tlx|abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}} will generate {{abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}}; [[mouseover|hovering]] over the rendered text causes a [[tooltip]] of the long form to pop up.\n\n===Ampersand===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:AMP|MOS:&}}\n\nIn normal text and headings, use \'\'and\'\' instead of the [[ampersand]] (\'\'&\'\'): {{xt|January 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2}}, not {{!xt|January 1&nbsp;&&nbsp;2}}. But retain an ampersand when it is a legitimate part of the style of a proper noun, the title of a work, or a trademark, such as in \'\'[[Up & Down (Horace Parlan album)|Up&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Down]]\'\' or [[AT&T]]. Elsewhere, ampersands may be used with consistency and discretion where space is extremely limited (e.g., tables and infoboxes). Quotations [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Typographic conformity|may be cautiously modified]], especially for consistency where different editions are quoted, as modern editions of old texts routinely replace ampersands with \'\'and\'\' (just as they replace other disused [[glyph]]s, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and abbreviations). Another frequent permissible but not required use is in short bibliographic references to works by multiple authors, e.g.: {{xt|<nowiki><ref>Lubbers & Scheepers (2002); Van Hiel & Mervielde (2002); Swyngedouw & Giles (2007); Van Hiel (2012).</ref></nowiki>}}.\n\n==Italics==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IT|MOS:ITAL}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Italic type}}\n\n===Emphasis<span id="Do not use capitals for emphasis"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Emphasis}}\n\nItalics are used for emphasis, rather than [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Boldface|boldface]] or [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#All caps and small caps|capitals]]. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.\n\nUse {{tag|em}} or {{tlx|em|...}} for emphasis.

Quotation marks may also be used for shorter material to avoid confusion, such as when italics are already heavily used in the page for another purpose (e.g., for many non-English words and phrases). {{em|Mentioning}} (to discuss grammar, wording, punctuation, etc.) is different from {{em|quoting}} (in which something is usually expressed on behalf of a quoted source). Quotation is done with quotation marks, never italics, nor both at once {{crossref|(see {{section link||Quotations}} for details).}}\n\nA closely related use of italics is when introducing or distinguishing terms: {{xt|The \'\'natural numbers\'\' are the integers greater than 0.}}\n\n===Non-English words <span class="anchor" id="Foreign words"></span> ===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English terms}}\nItalics are indicated for non-English phrases and isolated non-English words that are not commonly used in everyday English.

This is especially important in articles that are about or contain material about [[WP:BLP|living or recently deceased people]] (BLPs).\n\n===Original wording===\n<span class="anchor" id="Principle of minimal change"></span><span class="anchor" id="Minimal change"></span><span class="anchor" id="PMC"></span><span class="anchor" id="PLC"></span><span class="anchor" id="MINIMALCHANGE"></span><span class="anchor" id="MINCHANGE"></span><span class="anchor" id="LEASTCHANGE"></span>\n{{Redirect|WP:PMC|closure of requested moves by page movers|Wikipedia:Requested moves/Closing instructions#Closure by a page mover}}\n{{Redirect|WP:PLC|inclusion guidelines for organizations|Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|the handling of the abbreviation "plc" in article titles|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (companies)}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:PMC|MOS:SIC|MOS:TYPOFIX|WP:QUOTETYPO}}\n\nQuotations must be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiably]] attributed, and the wording of the quoted text must be faithfully reproduced. This is referred to as the {{strong|principle of minimal change}}. Where there is good reason to change the wording, bracket the changed text; for example, {{!xt|"Ocyrhoe told him his fate"}} might be quoted as {{xt|"Ocyrhoe told [her father] his fate"}}. If there is a significant error in the original, follow it with {{tlx|sic}} (producing {{xt|{{sic}}}}{{hsp}}) to show that the error was not made by Wikipedia. When applied to a title parameter within a <nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki> tag set or similar text creating links, the syntax of the template may be adjusted to {{tlx|sic|2=nolink=y}} (producing <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> in the resulting linked text). <!-- IF EDITING THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE, PLEASE UPDATE THE DOCUMENTATION AT [[Template:Sic/doc]] ACCORDINGLY --> However, insignificant spelling and typographic errors should simply be silently corrected (for example, correct {{!xt|basicly}} to {{xt|basically}}).\n\nUse [[#Ellipses|ellipses]] to indicate omissions from quoted text. Legitimate omissions include extraneous, irrelevant, or parenthetical words, and unintelligible speech ({{!xt|umm}} and {{!xt|hmm}}), but do not omit text where doing so would remove important context or alter the meaning of the text. Vulgarities and obscenities should be shown exactly as they appear in the quoted source; Wikipedians should [[Wikipedia:Offensive material#How to treat offensive material in articles|never bowdlerize words]] ({{!xt|G-d d--m it!}}), but if the text being quoted \'\'itself\'\' does so, copy the text verbatim and use {{tlx|sic}} to indicate that the text is quoted as shown in the source.\n\nIn direct quotations, retain dialectal and archaic spellings, including capitalization (but not archaic glyphs and ligatures, as detailed below in {{slink||Typographic conformity}}).\n\n===Point of view<span class="anchor" id="Quotation point of view"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:QUOTEPOV}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Attributing and specifying biased statements|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Expressions of doubt}}\n\nQuotation should be used, with attribution, to present emotive opinions that cannot be expressed in Wikipedia\'s own voice, but never to present cultural norms as simply opinional:\n\n*Acceptable: {{xt|Siskel and Ebert called the film "unforgettable".}}\n*Unacceptable: {{!xt|The site is considered "sacred" by the religion\'s scriptures.}}\n\nConcise opinions that are not overly emotive can often be reported with attribution instead of direct quotation.

This has no effect on searching for the works we have cited, since all major search engines disregard punctuation marks.}} should be adapted to English Wikipedia\'s conventions without comment, provided that doing so will not change or obscure meaning or intent of the text. These are alterations which make no difference when the text is read aloud, for example:\n\n*Normalize dashes and hyphens: see {{Section link||Dashes}}. Use the style chosen for the article: unspaced [[em dash]] or spaced [[en dash]].\n*Convert apostrophes and quotation marks to Wikipedia\'s style:\n**These should be straight, not curly or slanted. See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.\n**When quoting a quotation that itself contains a quotation, alternate between using double and single quotes for each quotation. See {{section link||For a quotation within a quotation}} for details.\n*When quoting text from non-English languages, the outer punctuation should follow [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation marks|the Manual of Style for English quote marks]]. If there are nested quotations, follow the rules for correct punctuation in that language. If there are multiple styles for a language, the one used by the Wikipedia for that language is preferred unless the punctuation itself is under discussion.\n*:{{xt|The cynical response "{{lang|fr|italic=unset|L\'auteur aurait dû demander&nbsp;: «&nbsp;à quoi sert-il d\'écrire ceci&nbsp;?&nbsp;» mais ne l\'a pas fait}}" was all he wrote.}}\n*Remove spaces before punctuation such as periods and colons.\n*Generally preserve bold and italics {{cross reference|(see {{section link||Italics}})}}, but most other styling should be altered. {{!xt|{{Underline|Underlining}}}}, {{!xt|spac&nbsp;ing}} within words, {{!xt|1=co<span style="color:Goldenrod;">lor</span>s}}, {{!xt|ALL CAPS}}, {{Smallcaps|{{!xt|small caps}}}}, etc. should generally be normalized to plain text. If it {{em|clearly}} indicates emphasis, use italic {{em|emphasis}} ({{tlx|em}}) or, in an already-italic passage, boldface (with {{tlx|strong}}). For titles of books, articles, poems, and so forth, use italics or quotation marks following [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles|the guidance for titles]]. Italics can also be added to mark up [[#Non-English term|non-English terms]] (with the {{tlx|lang}} template), for an [[#Animals, plants, and other organisms|organism\'s scientific name]], and to indicate a [[#Words as words|words-as-words]] usage.\n*Expand an abbreviation (not already used in the content before the quotation) as a square-bracketed change, or explain it using {{tlx|abbr}}.\n*Normalize archaic glyphs and ligatures in English that are unnecessary to the meaning. Examples include \'\'[[æ]]\'\'→\'\'ae\'\', \'\'[[œ]]\'\'→\'\'oe\'\', \'\'[[Long s|ſ]]\'\'→\'\'s\'\', and \'\'[[Thorn (letter)#Abbreviations|þ<sup>e</sup>]]\'\'→\'\'the\'\'. {{crossref|(See also {{section link||Ampersand}}.)}}\n\n{{crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Typographic conformity}} for special considerations in normalizing the typography of titles of works.}}\n\nHowever, national varieties should not be changed, as these may involve changes in vocabulary. For example, a quotation from a British source should retain British spelling, even in an article that otherwise uses American spelling. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Consistency within articles}}.)}} Numbers also usually [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Quotations, titles, etc.|should not be reformatted]].\n\nDirect quotation should not be used to preserve the formatting preferred by an external publisher (especially when the material would otherwise be unchanged), as this tends to have the effect of [[Scare quotes|scare-quoting]]:\n*{{em|Acceptable}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n*{{em|Unacceptable}}: {{!xt|The animal is listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nItalics can be used to mark a particular usage as a [[term of art]] (a case of "[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words as words]]"), especially when it is unfamiliar or should not be reworded by a non-expert:\n*{{em|Permissible}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as \'\'critically endangered\'\' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nWhen quoting a complete sentence, it is usually recommended to keep the first word capitalized. However, if the quoted passage has been integrated into the surrounding sentence (for example, with an introduction such as "{{var|X}} said that"), the original capital letter may be lower-cased.\n*{{xt|LaVesque\'s report stated: "The equipment was selected for its low price. This is the primary reason for criticism of the program."}}\n*{{xt|LaVesque\'s report said that "the equipment was selected for its low price".}}\n*{{xt|The program was criticized primarily because "the equipment was selected for its low price", according to LaVesque.}}\n\nIt is normally unnecessary to explicitly note changes in capitalization. However, for more precision, the altered letter may be put inside square brackets: {{nobr|"The" → "[t]he".}}\n*{{xt|The program was criticized primarily because {{nobr|"[t]he}} equipment was selected for its low price", according to LaVesque.}}\n\n===Attribution===\nThe reader must be able to determine the source of any quotation, at the very least via a footnote. The source must be named {{em|in article text}} if the quotation is an opinion {{Crossreference|(see {{Section link|Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Attributing and specifying biased statements}})}}. When attributing a quotation, avoid [[Wikipedia:Words to avoid#Synonyms for said|characterizing it in a biased manner]].\n\n===Quotations within quotations===\nSee {{section link||For a quotation within a quotation}}.\n\n===Linking===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LINKQUOTE|MOS:LWQ}}\n\nBe conservative when linking within quotations; link only to targets that correspond to the meaning clearly intended by the quote\'s author. Where possible, link from text outside of the quotation instead – either before it or soon after. (If quoting [[hypertext]], add an editorial note, {{xt|[link in original]}} or {{xt|[link added]}}, as appropriate, to avoid ambiguity as to whether the link was made by the original author.)\n\n===Block quotations<span class="anchor" id="Block quotations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Block quotes"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:BQ|MOS:BLOCKQUOTE}}\n\nFormat a long quote (more than about forty words or a few hundred characters, or consisting of more than one paragraph, regardless of length) as a [[block quotation]], indented on both sides. Block quotations should be enclosed in {{tlx|blockquote}}.\n\nDo not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid large, decorative quotation marks; those provided by the {{tlx|cquote}} template have been disabled in mainspace). Block quotations using a colored background are also discouraged.\n\nUse {{tnull|blockquote}} and so on only for actual quotations; [[#Indentation|indentation for other purposes]] is done differently.\n\nIt is conventional to precede a block quotation with an introductory sentence (or sentence fragment) and append the source citation to that line. Alternatively, the {{tnull|blockquote}} template provides parameters for attribution and citation which will appear below the quotation. {{Crossref|(For use of dashes with attributions, see {{section link||Other uses for em dashes}}.)}} This below-quotation attribution style is intended for famous quotations and is unusual in articles because it may strike an inappropriate tone. A quotation with no cited source should be flagged with {{tlx|quote without source}}, or deleted.\n\nLine breaks and indentation inside a {{tnull|blockquote}} or {{tag|blockquote|o}} are generally ignored; use {{xtag|poem}} or {{tlx|poem quote}} for poetry, lyrics, and similar material:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">\n{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis gives:\n{{xt|{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}}}\n\nOr quote such material inline, with line breaks indicated by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}/</nowiki></code>, and paragraph or stanza breaks by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}//</nowiki></code>.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:PQ|MOS:PULLQUOTE}}\n{{Anchor|Pull quotes|Pull quote|Pull quotations|nocquote|reason=The old name of Template:Pull_quote was Template:Cquote, and "nocquote" was historically used to refer to this MOS section, which now has its own shortcuts.}}\n[[Pull quote]]s do not belong in Wikipedia articles. These are the [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not news|news and magazine style]] of "pulling" material already in the article to reuse it in attention-grabbing decorative quotations. This unencyclopedic approach is a form of [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Editorializing|editorializing]], produces [[Wikipedia:Writing better articles#Provide context for the reader|out-of-context]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Due and undue weight|undue emphasis]], and may [[Wikipedia:No original research|lead the reader to conclusions]] not supported in the material.\n\n===Non-English quotations <span class="anchor" id="Foreign-language quotations"></span> ===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:FOREIGNQUOTE|MOS:QUOTEFOREIGN}}\n\nQuotations from non-English language sources should appear with a translation into English, preferably a modern{{efn|name=recent}} one. Quotations that are translations should be explicitly distinguished from those that are not. Indicate the original source of a translation (if it is available, and not first published within Wikipedia), and the original language (if that is not clear from the context).\n\nIf the original, untranslated text is available, provide a reference for it or include it, as appropriate.\n\nWhen editors themselves translate text into English, care must always be taken to include the original text, {{em|in italics}} (except for non-Latin-based writing systems, and best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template which both italicizes as appropriate and provides language metadata); and to use actual and (if at all possible) common English words in the translation. Unless you are certain of your competency to translate something, see [[Wikipedia:Translation]] for assistance.\n\n==Punctuation==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:PUNCT}}\n{{For|a brief guide to how some punctuation marks are used in Wikipedia for special purposes, e.g., [[Help:List#List basics|description lists]]|Help:Punctuation}}\n\n===Apostrophes===\n{{anchor|Foreign characters that resemble apostrophes|reason=Old subheading that was merged in.}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:\'|MOS:APOSTROPHE}}\n\n*Use straight apostrophes ({{big|{{mxt|\'}}}}), not curly apostrophes ({{big|{{!mxt|’}}}}).{{efn|name=curlyq}} Do not use accent marks or backticks ({{big|{{!mxt|`}}}}) as apostrophes.\n*Templates such as {{tlx|\'}} and {{tlx|\'s}} are helpful when an apostrophe (or single quote) appears at the beginning or end of text in italics or bold, because italics and bold are themselves indicated by sequences of single quotes.

There should be no space next to the inner side of a bracket. An opening bracket should usually be preceded by a space. This may not be the case if it is preceded by an opening quotation mark, another opening bracket, or a portion of a word:\n*{{xt|He rose to address the meeting: "(Ahem)&nbsp;... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!"}}\n*{{xt|Only the royal characters in the play ([Prince] Hamlet and his family) habitually speak in blank verse.}}\n*{{xt|We journeyed on the Inter[continental].}}\n*{{xt|Most people are right-handed. (Some people are left-handed, but that does not make right-handed people "better" than left-handed people.)}}\n\nThere should be a space after a closing bracket, except where a punctuation mark follows (though a spaced dash would still be spaced after a closing bracket) and in unusual cases similar to those listed for opening brackets.\n\nAvoid adjacent sets of brackets. Either put the parenthetical phrases in one set separated by semicolons, or rewrite:\n*{{em|Avoid}}: {{!xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) (also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919; also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.

They serve three main purposes:\n*To clarify: {{xt|She attended [secondary] school}}, where this was the intended meaning, but the type of school was unstated in the original sentence.\n*To reduce the size of a quotation: {{xt|X contains Y, and under certain circumstances, X may contain Z as well}} may be reduced to {{xt|X contains Y [and sometimes Z]}}.

The items in such a list may be separated by commas, or if they are more complex and perhaps themselves contain commas, the items should be separated by semicolons or arranged in a bulleted list.\n\n{{Block indent|{{xt|We visited several tourist attractions: the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which I thought could fall at any moment; the Bridge of Sighs; the supposed birthplace of Petrarch, or at least the first known house in which he lived; and so many more.}}}}\n\nA colon may also be used to introduce [[Quotation marks in English#Quotations and speech|direct speech]] enclosed within quotation marks. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.)}}\n\nIn most cases, a colon works best with a complete grammatical sentence before it. When what follows the colon is also a complete sentence, start it with a capital letter, but otherwise do not capitalize after a colon except where doing so is needed for another reason, such as for a proper name. When a colon is being used as a separator in an article title, section heading, or list item, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\nExcept in technical usage ({{xt|a 3:1 ratio}}), no sentence should contain multiple colons, no space should precede a colon, and a space (but never a hyphen or dash) should follow the colon.\n\n===Semicolons===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SEMICOLON|MOS:COMMASPLICE|MOS:;}}\n{{for|usage in marking up description (definition) lists|Help:List#Description lists}}\n\nA [[semicolon]] ({{xt|;}}) is sometimes an alternative to a full stop (period), enabling related material to be kept in the same sentence; it marks a more decisive division in a sentence than a comma. If the semicolon separates clauses, normally each clause must be independent (meaning that it could stand on its own as a sentence). In many cases, only a comma or only a semicolon will be correct in a given sentence.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Though he had been here before, I did not recognize him.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Though he had been here before; I did not recognize him.}}\n|}\n\nAbove, "Though he had been here before" cannot stand on its own as a sentence, and therefore is not an independent clause.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|}\n\nThis incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses is known as a [[comma splice]]; however, in certain kinds of cases, a comma may be used where a semicolon would seem to be called for:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"Life is short, art is long."}} (two brief clauses in an [[aphorism]]; see \'\'[[Ars longa, vita brevis]]\'\')\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"I have studied it, you have not."}} (reporting brisk conversation, such as this reply of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\'s)\n|}\n\nA sentence may contain several semicolons, especially when the clauses are parallel in construction and meaning; multiple unrelated semicolons are often signs that the sentence should be divided into shorter sentences or otherwise refashioned.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Unwieldy}}:\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline; pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Better}}:\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are alkaline, and pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|}\n\nSemicolons are used in addition to commas to separate items in a listing, when commas alone would result in confusion.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Confusing}}:\n| {{!xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts, San Francisco, California, Singapore, and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Clear}}:\n| {{xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Singapore; and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|}\n\n====Semicolon before "however"====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HOWEVER}}\n\nThe meaning of a sentence containing a trailing clause that starts with the word \'\'however\'\' depends on the punctuation preceding that word. A common error is to use the wrong punctuation, thereby changing the meaning to one not intended.\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is an adverb meaning "nevertheless", it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; however, they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; nevertheless, they tried.}}\n|}\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is a conjunction meaning "in whatever manner", or "regardless of how", it may be preceded by a comma but not by a semicolon, and should not be followed by punctuation. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, however they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, regardless of how they tried.}}\n|}\n\nIn the first case, the clause that starts with "however" cannot be swapped with the first clause; in the second case this can be done without change of meaning:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|However they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|Regardless of how they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|}\n\nIf the two clauses cannot be swapped, a semicolon is required.\n\nA sentence or clause can also contain the word \'\'however\'\' in the middle, if it is an adverb meaning "although" that could have been placed at the beginning but does not start a new clause in mid-sentence. In this use, the word may be enclosed between commas. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|He did not know, however, that the venue had been changed at the last minute.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|However, he did not know that the venue had been changed at the last minute.}}\n|}\n\n===Hyphens===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HYPHEN}}\n\n[[Hyphen]]s ({{xt|-}}) indicate conjunction.

Where there would otherwise be a loss of clarity, however, a hyphen may be used in the predicative form as well ({{xt|hand-fed turkeys}}, {{xt|the turkeys were hand-fed}}). Awkward attributive hyphenation can sometimes be avoided with a simple rewording: {{xt|Hawaiian-native species}} → {{xt|native Hawaiian species}}.\n#*Avoid using a hyphen after a standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverb ({{xt|a newly available home}}, {{xt|a wholly owned subsidiary}}) unless part of a larger compound ({{xt|a slowly-but-surely strategy}}). In rare cases, a hyphen can improve clarity if a rewritten alternative is awkward, but rewording is usually preferable: {{!xt|The idea was clearly stated enough}} can be disambiguated as {{xt|The idea clearly was stated often enough}} or {{xt|The idea was stated with enough clarity}}.\n#*A few words ending in \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' function as both adjectives and adverbs ({{xt|a kindly-looking teacher}}; {{xt|a kindly provided facility}}). Some such dual-purpose words (like {{xt|early}}, {{xt|only}}, {{xt|northerly}}) are not standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverbs, because they are not formed by addition of \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' to an independent current-English adjective. These need careful treatment: {{xt|Early flowering plants appeared around 130&nbsp;million years ago}}, but {{xt|Early-flowering plants risk damage from winter frosts}}; {{xt|only child actors}} (no adult actors) but {{xt|only-child actors}} (actors without siblings).\n#*A hyphen is normally used when the adverb \'\'well\'\' precedes a participle used attributively ({{xt|a well-meaning gesture}}; but normally {{xt|a very well managed firm}}, because \'\'well\'\' itself is modified) and even predicatively, if \'\'well\'\' is necessary to, or alters, the sense of the adjective rather than simply intensifying it ({{xt|the gesture was well-meaning}}, {{xt|the child was well-behaved}}, but {{xt|the floor was well polished}}).\n#*In some cases, such as {{xt|diode–transistor logic}}, the independent status of the linked elements requires an en dash instead of a hyphen. {{crossref|pw=y|See {{Section link||Dashes}}.}}\n#*{{shortcut|MOS:SUSPENDED|MOS:HANGING}}Use a \'\'\'[[suspended hyphen]]\'\'\' (also called a \'\'hanging hyphen\'\') when two compound modifiers are separated ({{xt|two- and three-digit numbers}}; {{xt|a ten-car or -truck convoy}}; {{xt|sloping right- or leftward}}).\n#*Values and units used as compound modifiers are hyphenated only where the unit is given as a whole word; when using the unit symbol, separate it from the number with a [[non-breaking space]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).\n\n<div class="block-indent" style="padding-left: 5em; padding-right: 0; overflow: hidden;"><!--The underlying code adapted from {{block indent}} which doesn\'t work around wikitables.-->\n{| style="background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|9-mm gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9&nbsp;mm gap}} (markup: <code>9&amp;nbsp;mm gap</code>)\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}}&nbsp; &nbsp; || {{!xt|9&nbsp;millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9-millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12-hour shift}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12&nbsp;h shift}} (markup: <code>12&amp;nbsp;h shift</code>)\n|}\n</div>\n\n\'\'\'Multi-word hyphenated items:\'\'\' It is often possible to avoid multi-word hyphenated modifiers by rewording ({{xt|a four-CD soundtrack album}} may be easier to read as {{xt|a soundtrack album of four CDs}}). This is particularly important where converted units are involved ({{xt|the 6-hectare-limit (14.8-acre-limit) rule}} might be possible as {{xt|the rule imposing a limit of six hectares (14.8 acres)}}, and the ungainly {{!xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) -long tributary}} as simply {{xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) tributary}}).\n\nFor optional hyphenation of compound \'\'\'points of the compass\'\'\' such as \'\'southwest/south-west\'\', see {{section link||Compass points}}.\n\nDo not use a capital letter after a hyphen except for a proper name following the hyphen: {{xt|Graeco-Roman}} and {{xt|Mediterranean-style}}, but not {{!xt|Gandhi-Like}}. In titles of published works, when given in [[title case]], follow the capitalization rule for each part independently ({{xt|\'\'The Out-of-Towners\'\'}}), unless reliable sources consistently do otherwise in a particular case ({{xt|\'\'The History of Middle-earth\'\'}}).\n\nHyphenation rules in other languages may be different. Thus, in French a place name such as {{xt|Trois-Rivières}} (\'Three Rivers\') is hyphenated, when it would not be in English. Follow reliable sources in such cases.\n\n\'\'\'Spacing:\'\'\' A hyphen is never followed or preceded by a space, except when hanging {{crossref|(see above)}} or when used to display parts of words independently, such as {{xt|the prefix sub-}}{{nbsp}}and {{xt|the suffix{{nbsp}}-less}}.\n\n\'\'\'Image filenames and redirects:\'\'\' Image filenames are not part of the encyclopedic content; they are tools. They are most useful if they can be readily typed, so they usually use hyphens instead of dashes. Similarly, article titles with dashes should also have a corresponding redirect from a copy of the title with hyphens: for example, {{xt|[[Michelson-Morley experiment]]}} redirects to {{xt|[[Michelson–Morley experiment]]}}.\n\n\'\'\'Non-breaking:\'\'\' A [[non-breaking hyphen]] ({{tlx|nbhyph}}) will {{em|not}} be used as a point of line-wrap.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SHY|MOS:SOFTHYPHEN}}\n{{Anchor|shy}}\n\'\'\'Soft hyphens:\'\'\' Use [[soft hyphen]]s to mark locations where a word will be broken and hyphenated {{em|if necessary}} at the end of a line of text, usually in [[Longest English words|very long words]] or narrow spaces (such as captions, narrow table columns, or text adjacent to a very wide image), for example: {{tlx|shy|Penn|syl|va|nia and Mass|a|chu|setts style themselves com|mon|wealths.}}. Use sparingly to avoid making wikitext difficult to read and edit. For more information, see [[Help:Line-break handling#%3Cwbr /%3E and soft hyphens|Help:Line-break handling]].\n\n\'\'\'Encoding\'\'\': The hyphen is represented by the {{small|ASCII/UNICODE [[hyphen-minus|HYPHEN-MINUS]]}} character, which is entered by the hyphen or minus key on all standard keyboards. Do not use the {{small|[[Hyphen#Unicode|UNICODE HYPHEN]]}} character.\n\nHyphenation involves many subtleties that cannot be covered here; the rules and examples presented above illustrate the broad principles.\n\n=== Dashes<span id="Em dashes"></span><span id="Unspaced em dash"></span><span id="En dashes"></span><span id="Spaced en dash"></span> ===\n{{redirect|WP:DASH|the overview of Wikipedia discussions|Wikipedia:Dashboard}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:DASH|MOS:EMDASH|MOS:ENDASH}}\n\nTwo forms of dash are used on Wikipedia: \'\'\'[[en dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|–}}) and \'\'\'[[em dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|—}}). To enter them, click on them in the [[Help:CharInsert|CharInsert toolbar]], or enter them manually as:\n*<code>&amp;ndash;</code> or <code>&amp;mdash;</code>\n*{{tlx|endash}} or {{tlx|emdash}}\nDo not use a double hyphen (<code>--</code>) to stand in for a dash. {{crossref|(See also: [[Wikipedia:How to make dashes]].)}}\n\nSources use dashes in varying ways. For consistency and clarity, Wikipedia adopts the following principles.\n\n====In article titles====\nIn [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article titles]], do not use a hyphen ({{xt|-}}) as a substitute for an en dash, for example in \'\'[[eye–hand span]]\'\' (since \'\'eye\'\' does not modify \'\'hand\'\'). Nonetheless, to aid searching and linking, provide a redirect with hyphens replacing the en dash(es), as in \'\'[[eye-hand span]]\'\'. Similarly, provide [[Template:Category redirect|category redirects]] for categories containing dashes. When an en dash is being used as a separator in an article title or section heading, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\n====In running text====\n{{Anchor|DASHVAR}}\nDashes are often used to mark divisions within a sentence: in pairs (parenthetical dashes, instead of parentheses or pairs of commas) or singly (perhaps instead of a colon). They may also indicate an abrupt stop or interruption in reporting quoted speech. In all such cases, either unspaced em dashes or spaced en dashes can be used, with consistency maintained throughout a given article:\n*An em dash is <em>unspaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected—but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\n*An en dash is <em>spaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\nIdeally, an en dash should be preceded by a non-breaking space; this prevents the dash from appearing at the beginning of a line. The {{tlx|snd}} template may be used for this:\n{{Block indent|{{mxt|<nowiki>Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.</nowiki>}}}}\nDo not insert any spaces where an en dash should be unspaced {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}})}}.\n\nDashes can clarify a sentence\'s structure when commas, parentheses, or both are also being used.\n*{{xt|The book summarizes works of some major philosophers in chronological order: Descartes, Locke, Hume{{snd}}but not his \'\'Treatise\'\' (deemed too complex for the target audience){{snd}}and Kant.}}\n\n<span class="anchor" id="Spare the dash"></span>{{Shortcut|MOS:SPARETHEDASH|MOS:NOTRIPLEDASH}}\nUse dashes sparingly.

It is used to <em>join</em> components less strongly than a hyphen would {{crossref|(see {{section link||Hyphens}})}}; conversely, it may also <em>separate</em> components less strongly than a slash would {{crossref|(see {{Section link||Slashes}})}}. Consider the relationship that exists between two components when deciding what punctuation to place between them.\n\n====Other uses for em dashes====\nAn [[#Indentation|indented]] em dash may be used when attributing the source of a passage, such as a [[#Block quotations|block quotation]] or poem. This dash should not be fully spaced: however, for reasons related to [[Wikipedia:Reuse|metadata]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]], it is best to place a [[hair space]] between the dash and the name.{{efn|name=hairspace|The [[hair space]] should be done as {{mxt|{{tl|hair space}}}} because the actual Unicode character ({{hair space}}) is almost invisible, the meaning of the numerical HTML entity ({{!mxt|&amp;#8202;}}) is relatively obscure, and the named HTML entity "{{!mxt|&amp;hairsp;}}" is not standard and unsupported in some browsers.}} Most of Wikipedia\'s quotation templates provide this formatting automatically.\n\nFor example, {{mxt|{{tlp|in5}}—{{tl|hair space}}Charlotte Brontë}} will produce:\n\n{{in5}}—{{hair space}}Charlotte Brontë\n\n====Other dashes====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NEGATIVE}}\n\nDo not use [[Typewriter#Typewriter conventions|typewriter approximations]] or other substitutes, such as two hyphens ({{!xt|--}}), for em or en dashes.\n\nFor a negative sign or subtraction operator use {{Unichar|2212|MINUS SIGN|nlink=Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|html=}}, which can also be generated by clicking on the {{Code|−}} following the {{Code|±}} in the {{xt|Insert}} toolbar beneath the edit window. Do not use {{Unichar|2212}} inside a {{tag|math|o}} tag, as the character gives a syntax error; instead use a normal hyphen {{Unichar|002D}}.\n\n===Slashes (strokes)<span class="anchor" id="Slashes"></span>===\n{{redirect|WP:SLASH|information on subpages, which contain a slash in their titles|WP:SUB}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SLASH|MOS:STROKE|MOS:/}}\n\nGenerally, avoid joining two words with a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], also called a forward slash, stroke or solidus ({{xt|&nbsp;/&nbsp;}}), because it suggests that the words are related without specifying how. Replace with clearer wording.\n\nAn example: {{!xt|The parent/instructor must be present at all times.}} Must both be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent and the instructor}}.) Must at least one be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent or the instructor}}.) Are they the same person? (Use a hyphen: {{xt|the parent-instructor}}.)\n\nIn circumstances involving a distinction or disjunction, the en dash {{crossref|(see above)}} is usually preferable to the slash: {{xt|the digital–analog distinction}}.\n\nAn unspaced slash may be used:\n*to indicate [[phonemic]] [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation|pronunciations]] ({{xt|\'\'rivet\'\' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈrɪvət/}}}});\n*in a fraction (<code>7/8</code>, but see other techniques at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Fractions and ratios}});\n*to indicate regular defined yearly periods that do not coincide with calendar years (e.g., {{xt|the 2009/2010 fiscal year}}), if that is the convention used in reliable sources (see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Long periods of time}} for further explanation);\n*to express a ratio, in a form in which a slash is conventionally used (e.g., {{xt|the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio for short}});\n*in an expression or abbreviation widely used outside Wikipedia (e.g., {{xt|n/a}} or {{xt|N/A}} for \'\'not applicable\'\').\n\nA spaced slash may be used:\n*to separate run-on lines in quoted poetry or song ({{xt|To be or not to be: that is the question:&nbsp;/ Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer&nbsp;/ The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune}}), or rarely in quoted prose, where careful marking of a paragraph break is textually important;\n*to separate items that include at least one internal space ({{xt|the NY&nbsp;31 east&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;370 exit}}), where for some reason use of a slash is unavoidable.\n\nTo avoid awkward linebreaks, code spaced slashes (and fraction slashes) with a non-breaking space on the left and a normal space on the right, as in: <code>My mama told me&amp;nbsp;/ You better shop around</code>. For short constructions, both spaces should be non-breaking: {{nobr|<code>x&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;y</code>}}. On the other hand, if two long words are connected by an unspaced slash, an {{tl|wbr}} added after the slash will allow a linebreak at that point.\n\nDo not use the [[backslash]] character ({{!xt|&nbsp;\\&nbsp;}}) in place of a slash.\n\nPrefer the division operator ({{xt|&nbsp;÷&nbsp;}}) to slash or fraction slash when representing elementary arithmetic in general text: {{xt|{{nowrap|10 ÷ 2 {{=}} 5}}}}. In more advanced mathematical formulas, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] or slash is preferred: <math>\\textstyle\\frac{x^n}{n!}</math> or {{xt|{{var|x}}<sup>{{var|n}}</sup>/{{var|n}}!}} {{cross reference|1=(see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Common mathematical symbols}} and [[Help:Displaying a formula]])}}.\n\n====And/or====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ANDOR}}\n\nAvoid writing {{!xt|and/or}} unless other constructions would be lengthy or awkward. Instead of {{!xt|Most had trauma and/or smoke inhalation}}, write simply {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation}} (which would normally be interpreted as an [[inclusive-or]] to imply \'\'or both\'\'); or, for emphasis or precision or both, write {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation or both}}. Where more than two possibilities are present, instead of {{!xt|x, y, and/or{{nbsp}}z}} write {{xt|one or more of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}} or {{xt|some or all of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}}.\n\n=== Symbols ===\nUnicode symbols are preferred over composed [[ASCII]] symbols for improved readability and accessibility.

If a quoted phrase or title ends in a question mark or exclamation mark, it may confuse readers as to the nature of the article sentence containing it, and so is usually better reworded to be mid-sentence. Where such a word or phrase occurs mid-sentence, new terminal punctuation (usually a period) must be added at the end.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Acceptable}}: || {{xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?}}\n|-\n| {{em|Better}}: || {{xt|Slovak, having grown tired of What Is This?, returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr..}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr.}}\n|}\n\n===Punctuation and footnotes===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:CITEPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTFOOT|MOS:REFPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTREF|MOS:REFSPACE|MOS:PF}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Citing sources}}\n\'\'\'Reference tags\'\'\' ({{tag|ref}}) are used to create \'\'[[Help:Footnotes|footnotes]]\'\' (also called \'\'endnotes\'\' or simply \'\'notes\'\'), as [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Inline citations|citation footnotes]] and sometimes [[Help:Explanatory notes|explanatory notes]].

Adjacent reference tags should have no space between them, nor should there be any between tags and [[:Category:Inline templates|inline dispute and cleanup templates]].\n\nWhen reference tags are used, a [[Help:Footnotes#Creating the footnote list|footnote list]] must be added, and this is usually placed in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Notes and references|References]] section, near the end of the article in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Standard appendices and footers|standard appendices and footers]].\n\n*<em>Example</em>: [[Flightless bird]]s have a reduced [[Keel (bird anatomy)|keel]],{{Dummy ref|10}} and they also have smaller wing bones than flying birds of similar size.{{Dummy ref|11}}{{Dummy ref|12}}\n\n\'\'\'Exceptions\'\'\': Reference tags are placed <em>before</em> dashes, not after.

See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics|Punctuation after formulae}}.\n\n==Dates and time==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Chronological items}}\n\nDates should be [[Wikipedia:Linking|linked]] only when they are germane and topical to the subject, as discussed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Chronological items}}. For ranges of dates and times, see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}}.\n\n===Time of day===\n{{Main|MOS:TIME}}\n\nTimes of day are normally expressed in figures rather than words. Context determines whether the [[12-hour clock|12-]] or the [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] format is more appropriate.\n*Twelve-hour clock times are written in one of two forms: {{xt|11:15&nbsp;a.m.}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;p.m.}}, or {{xt|11:15&nbsp;am}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;pm}} (wherein the spaces should be [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking]]). Use {{xt|noon}} and {{xt|midnight}} rather than {{!xt|12&nbsp;pm}} and {{!xt|12&nbsp;am}}; it may need to be specified whether \'\'midnight\'\' refers to the start or end of a date.\n*Twenty-four-hour clock times are written in the form {{xt|08:15}} and {{xt|22:55}}, with no suffix. Midnight written as {{xt|00:00}} begins the day; {{xt|24:00}} ends it.\n\n===Dates<span id="Choice of format"></span><span id="Days"></span>===\n{{Main|MOS:DATEFORMAT}}\n\nFull dates are formatted {{xt|{{nobr|10 June 1921}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10, 1921}}}}; or where the year is omitted, use {{xt|{{nobr|10 June}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10}}}}.\n*The dates in the \'\'text\'\' of any one article should all have the same format (day-first or month-first).\n**For date formats in citations, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Citation style}}.\n**Dates in quotations and titles are always left as-is.\n**If a numerical format is required (e.g., for conciseness in lists and tables), use the YYYY-MM-DD format: {{xt|{{nobr|2005-04-03}}}}.\n*Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the more common date format for that country (month-first for the US, except in military usage; day-first for most others; articles related to Canada may use either consistently). Otherwise, do not change an article from one date format to the other without good reason.\n\n===Months===\n{{Main|MOS:MONTH}}\n*For month and year, write {{xt|June 1921}}, with no comma.\n*Abbreviations for months, such as {{xt|Feb}}, are used only where space is extremely limited. Such abbreviations should use three letters only, and should not be followed by a period (full point) except at the end of a sentence.\n\n===Seasons===\n{{Main|MOS:SEASON}}\n*Avoid ambiguous references to [[seasons]], which are different in the southern and northern hemispheres.\n*Names of seasons may be used when there is a logical connection to the event being described ({{xt|the autumn harvest}}) or when referring to a phase of a natural yearly cycle ({{xt|migration typically starts in mid-spring}}). Otherwise, neutral wording is usually preferable ({{xt|He was elected in November 1992}}, not {{!xt|He was elected in the fall of 1992}}).\n*Journals and other publications that are issued seasonally (e.g., "Summer 2005") should be dated as such in citations {{crossref|(for more information, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Seasonal publication dates and differing calendar systems}})}}.\n\n===Years and longer periods===\n{{Main|MOS:DECADE|MOS:CENTURY|MOS:ERA}}\n*Do not use \'\'the year\'\' before the digits ({{xt|1995}}, not {{!xt|the year 1995}}), unless the meaning would otherwise be unclear.\n*Decades are written in the format {{xt|the 1980s}}, with no apostrophe. Use the two-digit form (\'80s) only with an established social or cultural meaning. Avoid forms such as {{!xt|the 1700s}} that could refer to ten or a hundred years.\n*Years are denoted by [[Anno Domini|AD and BC]] or, equivalently, [[Common Era|CE and BCE]]. Use only one system within an article, and do not change from one system to the other without good reason. The abbreviations are written without periods, and with a [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking space]], as in {{xt|5&nbsp;BC}}. Omit AD or CE unless omitting it would cause ambiguity.\n\nMore information on all the above topics can be found at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Chronological items}}, including the handling of dates expressed in different calendars, and times corresponding to different time zones.\n\n===Current===\n{{Main|MOS:CURRENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:As of|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Relative time references}}\n\nTerms such as "current", "now", and "recent"{{efn|name=recent}} should be avoided. What is current today may not be tomorrow; situations change over time. Instead, use date- and time-specific text. To help keep information updated use {{tlx|As of}}, which will allow editors to catalog and update dated statements.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He is the current ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|As of March 2011, he is the ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|}\n\n==Numbers<span id="Spelling out numbers"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Numbers}}\n*Integers from zero to nine are spelled out in words. Integers greater than nine {{em|expressible in one or two words}} may be expressed either in numerals or in words. Other numbers are given in numerals or in forms such as {{xt|21{{nbsp}}million}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}}.\n*In general, in numbers with five or more digits to the left of the decimal point, use commas to group those digits. Numbers with four digits are at the editor\'s discretion: {{xt|12,345}}, but either {{xt|1,000}} or {{xt|1000}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Grouping of digits}}.\n*In general, use decimals rather than fractions for measurements, but fractions are sometimes used with [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[U.S. customary units|U.S. customary]] units. Keep articles internally consistent.\n*[[Scientific notation]] (e.g., {{xt|{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}}}) is preferred in scientific contexts. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}</nowiki></code>.\n*Write out "million" and "billion" on the first use. After that, unspaced "M" can be used for millions and "bn" for billions: {{xt|70M}} and {{xt|25bn}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}} for similar words.\n*Write {{xt|3%}}, {{xt|three percent}}, or {{xt|three per cent}}, but not {{!xt|3{{nbsp}}%}} (with a space) or {{!xt|three{{nbsp}}%}}. "Percent" is American usage, and "per cent" is British usage {{crossref|(see {{section link||National varieties of English}})}}. In ranges of percentages written with an en dash, write only a single percent sign: {{xt|3–14%}}.\n*Indicate uncertainties as e.g., {{xt|{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}}}. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}</nowiki></code>. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Uncertainty and rounding}} for other formats.\n\n==Currencies==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Currencies and monetary values}}\n*Use the full abbreviation on first use ({{xt|US$}} for the US dollar and {{xt|A$}} for the Australian dollar), {{em|unless the currency is already clear from context}}. For example, the government of the United States always spends money in American dollars, and never in Canadian or Australian dollars.\n*Use only one symbol with ranges, as in {{xt|$250–300}}.\n*In articles that are not specific to a country, express amounts of money in [[United States dollars]], [[euros]], or [[pounds sterling]]. Do not link the names or symbols of currencies that are commonly known to English-speakers ({{xt|$}}, {{xt|€}}, {{xt|£}}), unless there is a particular reason to do so; do not use potentially ambiguous currency symbols, unless the meaning is clear in the context.\n*In country-specific articles, use the currency of the country. On first occurrence, consider including conversion to US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling, at a rate appropriate to the context. For example, {{xt|Since 2001 the grant has been 10,000,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] (€1.0M as of August 2009)}}. Wording such as "approx." is not appropriate for simple rounding-off of the converted amount.\n*Generally, use the full name of a currency, and link it on its first appearance if English-speakers are likely to be unfamiliar with it ({{xt|52 [[Nepalese rupee]]s}}); subsequent occurrences can use the currency sign (just {{xt|88 Rs}}).\n*Most currency symbols are placed {{em|before}} the number, and unspaced {{nobr|({{xt|$123}} not {{!xt|$ 123}}).}}\n\n==Units of measurement==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Units of measurement}}\n*The main unit in which a quantity is expressed should generally be an [[International System of Units|SI]] unit or [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|non-SI unit officially accepted for use with the SI]]. However,\n**Scientific articles may also use specialist units appropriate for the branch of science in question.\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United States, the main unit is generally a U.S. customary unit ({{xt|22 pounds (10 kg)}}).\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United Kingdom, although the main unit is generally a metric unit ({{xt|10 kilograms (22 lb)}}), imperial units are still used as the main units in some contexts ({{xt|7 miles (11 km) by road}}).\n*Where English-speaking countries use different units for the same measurement, provide a conversion in parentheses. Examples: {{xt|the Mississippi River is {{convert|2320|mi|km|0}} long}}; {{xt|the Murray River is {{convert|2375|km|mi|0}} long}}. See {{tlx|convert}}.\n*In a direct quotation, always retain the source\'s units. Any conversion should follow in square brackets (or, an obscure use of units can be explained in the article text or a [[Wikipedia:Footnotes|footnote]]).\n*Where space is limited (such as tables, infoboxes, parenthetical notes, and mathematical formulas) unit symbols are preferred. In prose, unit names should be given in full if used only a few times but symbols may be used when a unit (especially one with a long name) is used repeatedly after spelling out the first use (e.g., {{xt|Up to 15 kilograms of filler is used for a batch of 250{{nbsp}}kg}}), except for unit names that are hardly ever spelled out ({{xt|°C}} rather than {{!xt|degrees Celsius}}).\n*Most unit names are not capitalized (see {{section link||National varieties of English}} for spelling differences).\n*Use "per" when writing out a unit, rather than a slash: {{xt|metre per second}}, not {{!xt|metre/second}}.\n*Units unfamiliar to general readers should be presented as a name–symbol pair on first use, linking the unit name ({{xt|Energies were originally 2.3 [[megaelectronvolt]]s (MeV), but were eventually 6{{nbsp}}MeV}}).\n*For ranges, see {{section link||En dashes: other uses}}, and MOS:NUM, at {{section link|nopage=y|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Date ranges|Percentages|Unit names and symbols|Formatting of monetary values}}.\n*Unit symbols are preceded by figures, not by spelled-out numbers. Values and unit symbols are separated by a [[non-breaking space]]. For example, {{xt|5&nbsp;min}}. The percent sign and units of degrees, minutes, and seconds {{em|for angles and coordinates}} are unspaced.\n\n==Common mathematical symbols==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMONMATH}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics}}\n*For a negative sign or subtraction operator, use a minus sign ({{xt|−}}, Unicode character U+2212 <small>MINUS SIGN</small>). Input by clicking on it in the insert box beneath the edit window or by typing <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n*For multiplication, use a multiplication sign ({{unichar|d7|MULTIPLICATION SIGN}}) or a dot ({{unichar|22c5|DOT OPERATOR}}), which are input by clicking on them in the edit toolbox under the edit window or by entering <code>&amp;times;</code> or <code>&amp;sdot;</code>. Care should be taken not to confuse the dot operator (in the "Math and logic" section of the edit toolbox) with an interpunct (in the "Insert" section of the edit toolbox) or a bullet. The letter {{xt|x}} should not be used to indicate multiplication, but it is used (unspaced) as the substitute for "by" in terms such as {{xt|[[4x4]]}}.\n*[[Exponentiation]] is indicated by a superscript, {{xt|\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup>}} (typed as <code><nowiki>\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup></nowiki></code>.\n*Do not use programming language notation outside computer program text. In most programming languages, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation are represented by the [[hyphen-minus]] <code>-</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code>, and either the [[caret]] <code>^</code> or the double asterisk <code>**</code> respectively; [[scientific notation]] is replaced by [[E notation]].\n*Symbols for [[binary operator]]s and [[binary relation|relations]] are usually spaced on both sides:\n**plus, minus, and plus-or-minus (as binary operators): {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|5&nbsp;−&nbsp;3}});\n**multiplication and division: {{xt|×}}, {{xt|÷}};\n**equals, does not equal, equals approximately: {{xt|{{=}}}}, {{xt|≠}}, {{xt|≈}};\n**is less than, is less than or equal to, is greater than, is greater than or equal to: {{xt|<}}, {{xt|≤}}, {{xt|>}}, {{xt|≥}}.\n*Symbols for [[unary operator]]s are closed-up to their operand:\n**positive, negative, and positive-or-negative signs: {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|−3}});\n**other unary operators, such as the exclamation mark as a [[factorial]] sign (as in {{xt|5!}}).\n*Variables are italicized, but digits and punctuation are not; only \'\'x\'\' and \'\'y\'\' are italicized in {{xt|2(5\'\'x\'\'&nbsp;+&nbsp;\'\'y\'\')<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*{{tlx|math}} can be used to style formulas to distinguish them from surrounding text.

In North American English, these words are almost invariably treated as singular; the major exception is that when a sports team is referred to by its short name, plural verbs are commonly used, e.g. {{xt|the [[Miami Heat|Heat]] are playing the Lakers tonight}}.\n\nNames of towns and countries usually take singular verbs (even when grammatically plural: {{xt|the United States is in North America}}, {{xt|the Netherlands is also known as Holland}}), but exceptionally in British English, typically when used to refer to a sports team named after a town or country or when discussing actions of a government, plural is used. For example, in {{xt|[[England national football team|England]] are playing [[Germany national football team|Germany]] tomorrow}}, \'\'England\'\' refers to a [[Association football|football]] team; but in {{xt|England is in the Northern hemisphere}}, it refers to the country.

While style guides with fewer than five years in print have not been in publication long enough to have had as much real-world impact as those from around 2000–2015 (on which MoS is primarily based), the corpora used for [[Google ngrams|Google {{var|n}}grams]] are updated through 2019, and we frequently [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#Some search engine tests|rely on]] what they indicate from the late 20th century and onward.}} reliable sources.

Exception: Do not expunge or replace names in source citations (whether as authors or mentioned in work titles).\n*Former names under which a living person was notable should be introduced with "born" or "formerly" in the lead sentence of their main biographical article. Name and gender matters should be explained at first appearance in that article, without overemphasis. In articles on works or other activities of such a person, use their current name by default, and give another name associated with that context in a parenthetical or footnote, only if they were notable under that name. In other articles, do not go into detail about such a person\'s name or gender except when directly relevant to the context.\n*Avoid confusing constructions by rewriting. Paraphrase, elide, or use square brackets to replace portions of quotations as needed to avoid confusion, former names, and mismatching gendered words.\n{{Crossref|printworthy=y|For examples and finer points, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Gender identity}}.}}\n\n===Non-English terms <span class="anchor" id="Foreign terms"></span> ===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NON-ENG|WP:!EN|MOS:FOREIGN}}\n{{See also|WP:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Other languages|WP:Manual of Style/Lead section#Foreign language|:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style (regional)|Help:Interlanguage links}}\n\n==== Terms without common usage in English <span class="anchor" id="No common usage in English"></span> ====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English language terms}}\n\nNon-English terms should be used sparingly. In general, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Foreign terms|use italics]] for phrases and words that are not current in English. This is best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template using the appropriate [[ISO language code]], e.g., {{tlx|lang|es|casa}}. There are alternatives to the {{tnull|lang}} template which also provide additional information about a non-English word or phrase, such as a link to the language name; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see [[:Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates]]}}. As Wikipedia does not apply italics to names of people, places, or organizations, the alternative template {{tlx|langr}} can be used to apply the language markup without italicizing.{{efn|This has the benefit of helping screen readers pronounce the name correctly. Such a proper name may be italicized when contrasting it with a conventional English form: {{xt|Munich ({{lang-de|München|link=no}})}}.}} Templates like {{tlx|lang}} automatically italicize text written using the Latin alphabet, so specifying italics is unnecessary. \n\nText written in non-Latin scripts such as Greek, Cyrillic, and Chinese should not be italicized or put in bold, as the difference in script is already sufficient to visually distinguish the text. Generally, any non-Latin text should include an appropriate romanization.\n\n====Terms with common usage in English====\n{{anchor|Common usage in English|reason=Old section name, surely has incoming links.}}\n[[Loanword]]s and borrowed phrases that have common usage in English{{snd}}{{xt|Gestapo}}, {{xt|samurai}}, {{xt|vice versa}}{{snd}}do not require italics.

If a particular romanization of the subject\'s name is [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names|most common]] in English ({{xt|Tchaikovsky}}, {{xt|Chiang Kai-shek}}), that form should be used. Otherwise, the romanization of names should adhere to a particular widely used system for the language in question ({{xt|Aleksandr Tymoczko}}, {{xt|Wang Yanhong}}). \n\nThe use of [[diacritic]]s in non-English words is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Use generally depends on whether they appear in reliable English-language sources, though with some additional constraints imposed by site guidelines. Provide [[Wikipedia:Redirect#Alternative names and languages|redirects]] from alternative forms that include or exclude diacritics.\n\nProper names in languages written using the [[Latin alphabet]] can include letters with diacritics, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and other characters that are not commonly used in contemporary English. Wikipedia normally retains these special characters, except where there is a well-established English spelling that replaces them with English standard letters. Examples:\n* The name of the article on Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] is spelt with the [[double acute accent]], and the alternative spellings \'\'Paul Erdos\'\' and \'\'Paul Erdös\'\' redirect to that article.\n* Similarly, the name of the article on the Nordic god [[Ægir]] is so spelt, with redirects from the ligature-free form [[Aegir]] and the Swedish spelling [[Ägir]].\n* However, the region of Spain named {{lang|es|Aragón}} in Spanish and {{lang|ca|Aragó}} in Catalan is given as [[Aragon]], without the accent, as this is the established English name. Non-English forms with diacritics appear in the article\'s lead section.\nUse of diacritics is determined on a topic-by-topic basis; a [[Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus|small group of editors]] cannot prohibit or require the use of diacritics within a given class of articles.{{efn|1=See the near-unanimous [[Special:PermanentLink/496631631#RfC:_Can_a_wikiproject_require_no-diacritics_names,_based_on_an_organisation\'s_rule_or_commonness_in_English_press?|RfC]], repeated [[Special:PermanentLink/664830645|deletion]] at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion]] of an anti-diacritics "wikiproject", the policy {{section link|Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus}}, and the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee]]\'s standardized [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Principles 2#Levels of consensus|\'\'statements of principles\'\' on such matters]].}}\n\nSpell a name consistently in the title and the text of an article. {{crossref|(Relevant policy: [[Wikipedia:Article titles]]; see also [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]].)}} For a non-English name, phrase, or word, adopt the spelling most commonly used in English-language [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable sources|reliable sources]], including but not limited to those already cited in the article.{{efn|name=GScholar|1=Reputable English-language encyclopedias and dictionaries in the aggregate are often helpful in [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Widely accepted name|determining the most widely accepted spelling]] of a place name, loanwords, etc. It may also help ([[Wikipedia:Google test|within limits]]) to compare search results from the [[Google Scholar]] journal index, for topics likely to be covered in peer-reviewed academic papers.}} For punctuation of compounded forms, see relevant guidelines in {{section link||Punctuation}}.\n\n[[Proper and common nouns|Proper name]]s in non-English languages should generally not be italicized, unless another reason applies; such as with [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles of works#FOREIGNTITLE|titles of major published works]], e.g., [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|{{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}]]; or when being compared to other names for the same subject in a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words-as-words]] manner, e.g., {{xt|\'\'\'Nuremberg\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Nürnberg}})}}. When non-English text should not be italicized, it can still be properly tagged by using the {{tlx|lang}} template with the {{para|italic|unset}} parameter: {{tlx|lang|de|italic{{=}}unset|Nürnberg}}.\n\nSometimes usage will be influenced by other guidelines, such as {{section link||National varieties of English}}, which may lead to different choices in different articles.\n\n====Other non-English concerns<span class="anchor" id="Other concerns"></span>====\n*For non-English vernacular names of species, see {{section link||Animals, plants, and other organisms}}.\n*For handling of quotations in languages other than English, see {{section link||Non-English quotations}}.\n*For non-English characters that resemble single quotation marks and apostrophes, see {{section link||Apostrophes}}.\n*For actual non-English quotation characters, see {{section link||Quotation characters}}.\n*For the capitalization in the titles of non-English language works, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Capitalization in foreign-language titles}}.\n*For linear and [[interlinear gloss]]es and their particular uses of small-caps (and italics and single quotes), see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#All caps and small caps}}.\n\n===Technical language<span id="JARGON"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:JARGON}}\n{{redirect|Wikipedia:Jargon|an explanation of jargon used on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Glossary}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a manual, guidebook, textbook, or scientific journal|Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable}}\n\nSome topics are necessarily technical: however, editors should seek to write articles accessible to the greatest possible number of readers. Minimize the use of [[jargon]], and adequately explain its meaning when it is used. Overly technical material can be tagged with {{tlx|Technical}} or {{tlx|Technical-statement}}, so that it can be addressed by other editors. For topics that require a more technical approach, the creation of a separate introductory article (like [[Introduction to general relativity]]) may be a solution.\n\nExcessive \'\'wikilinking\'\' (linking within Wikipedia) can result from trying too hard to avoid putting explanations in parenthetical statements, like the one that appeared earlier in this sentence. Do not introduce specialized words simply to teach them to the reader when more widely understood alternatives will do. \n\nWhen the concepts underlying the jargon used in an article are too complex to explain concisely in a parenthetical, [[Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable#Write one level down|write one level down]]. For example, consider adding a brief background section with {{tlx|main}} tags pointing to articles with a fuller treatment of the prerequisite material. This approach is practical only when the prerequisite concepts are central to the exposition of the article\'s main topic and when such prerequisites are not too numerous. Short articles, such as [[Wikipedia:Stub|stubs]], generally do not have such sections.\n\n{{crossref|printworthy=y|For italicization and other markup of introduced terms, see: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words}}.}}\n\n===Geographical items===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:GEO|MOS:PLACE}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations#Special considerations}}\n\n<section begin="MOS:GEO" />\'\'\'Geographical\'\'\' or \'\'\'place names\'\'\' are the nouns used to refer to specific places and geographic features. These names often give rise to conflict, because the same places are called different things by different peoples speaking different languages. Many place names have a historical context that should be preserved, but common sense should prevail. There can be few places that have not been parts of more than one culture or have had only one name. As proper nouns, all such place names (but not terms for types of places) [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Place names|have major words capitalized]].\n\nA place should generally be referred to consistently by the same name as in the title of its article {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]])}}. An exception may be made when there is a widely accepted historical English name appropriate to the given context. In cases where such a historical name is used, it should be followed by the modern{{efn|name=recent}} name in round brackets (parentheses) on the first occurrence of the name in applicable sections of the article. This resembles linking; it should not be done to the detriment of style. On the other hand, it is probably better to provide such a variant too often than too rarely. If more than one historical name is applicable for a given context, the other names should be added after the modern English name, that is: "historical name (modern name, other historical names)".\n\nThis is an English-language encyclopedia, so established English names are preferred if they exist, and spellings in non-English alphabets should always be transcribed into the Roman alphabet. In general, other articles should refer to places by the names which are used in the articles on those places, according to the rules described at [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]]. If a different name is appropriate in a given historical or other context, then that may be used instead, although it is normal to follow the first occurrence of such a name with the standard modern name in parentheses.\n\nAt the start of an article, provide notable equivalent names from other languages, including transcriptions where necessary: \n:\'\'\'Cologne\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Köln|link=no}}, IPA: {{IPA|[kœln]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n:\'\'\'Mount Fuji\'\'\' ({{lang|ja|富士山}} {{translit|ja|Fuji-san}}, IPA: {{IPA|[ɸuʥisaɴ]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n\nNames in languages with no particular present-day or historical ties to the place in question (English excepted, of course) should {{em|not}} be listed as alternatives.\n\nAvoid anachronism. An article about [[Junípero Serra]] should say he lived in [[Alta California|Alta Mexico]], not in [[California]], because the latter entity did not yet exist in Serra\'s time. The Romans invaded [[Gaul]], not [[France]], and [[Thabo Mbeki]] was the president of the [[Republic of South Africa]], not of the [[Cape Colony]]. To be clear, you may sometimes need to mention the current name of the area (for example "in what is now France"), especially if no English name exists for that area in the relevant historical period.<section end="MOS:GEO" />\n\n==Media files==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Creation and usage of media files}}\n\n===Images===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IM}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Images}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Images|Wikipedia:Image use policy|Wikipedia:Picture tutorial}}\n\n*Each image should be inside the level{{nbs}}2 section to which it relates, within the section defined by the most recent <code>==Heading==</code> delimited by two equal signs, or at the top of the lead section.

Redundant links (like the one in {{!xt|the tallest people on [[Earth]]}}) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that {{em|are}} worth pursuing should stand out clearly.\n\n\'\'\'Linking to sections\'\'\': A hash sign&nbsp;(<code>#</code>) followed by the appropriate heading will lead to a relevant part of a page. For example, <code><nowiki>[[Apostrophe#Use in non-English names]]</nowiki></code> links to a particular section of the article [[Apostrophe]].\n\n\'\'\'Initial capitalization\'\'\': Wikipedia\'s [[MediaWiki]] software does not require that wikilinks begin with an upper-case character. Capitalize the first letter only where this is naturally called for, or when specifically referring to the linked article by its name (see also related rule for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Uses of italics that are specific to Wikipedia|italics in cross-references]]): {{xt|[[Snake]]s are often [[venomous]], but [[lizard]]s only rarely {{crossreference|(see [[Poison]])}}.}}\n\n\'\'\'Check links\'\'\': Ensure the destination is the intended one; many dictionary words lead to disambiguation pages and not to complete or well-chosen articles.\n\n===External links===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:External links}}\n\nExternal links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an \'\'External links\'\' section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. The standard format is a primary heading, <code>==External links==</code>, followed by a bulleted list of links. Identify the link and briefly indicate its relevance to the article. For example:\n\n{{Block indent|{{plain list|\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]</syntaxhighlight>\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]</syntaxhighlight>\n}} }}\n\nThese will appear as:\n\n{{Block indent|\n*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]\n*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]\n}}\n\nWhere appropriate, use [[:Category:External link templates|external link templates]] such as {{tlx|Official website}} and {{tlx|URL}}.\n\nAdd external links with discretion; Wikipedia is [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files|not a link repository]].\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n===Keep markup simple===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:MARKUP|MOS:SIMPLIFY}}\n[[File:Keep it Simple.jpg|right|90px]]\nOther things being equal, keep [[Help:Wiki markup|markup]] simple. This makes wikitext easier to understand and edit, and the results seen by the reader more predictable. Use HTML and CSS markup sparingly. See: [[KISS principle]].\n\nIn general, wikitext formatting is considered easier to use than HTML and wikitext is preferred if there are equivalents; see [[Help:HTML in wikitext]]. [[Wikipedia:HTML 5#Obsolete elements and attributes|Obsolete elements and attributes]] should be updated or removed. There are many templates that allow HTML markup to be used without putting it in articles directly, such as {{tl|em}} (see [[MOS:EMPHASIS]]) and {{tl|strong}} (see [[MOS:BOLD]]).\n\nAn [[Character entity reference|HTML character entity]] is sometimes better than the equivalent Unicode character, which may be difficult to identify in edit mode; for example, <code>&amp;Alpha;</code> is explicit whereas <code>&Alpha;</code> (the upper-case form of Greek <code>α</code>) may be misidentified as the Latin <code>A</code>.\n{{further|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Best practice: wiki markup and CSS classes}}\n\n===Formatting issues===\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting}}\n\nModifications in font size, blank space, and color {{crossref|(see {{section link||Color coding}})}} are an issue for the Wikipedia site-wide [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheet]] and should be reserved for special cases only.\n\nTypically, the use of custom font styles:\n*reduces consistency, as the text no longer looks uniform;\n*reduces usability, as it may be impossible for people with custom style sheets (e.g. for accessibility reasons) to override it, and may clash with a different [[Skin (computing)|skin]] or inconvenience people with color blindness {{crossref|(see below)}}; and\n*causes disputes, as other editors may disagree aesthetically with the choice of style.\n\nSpecify font sizes {{em|relatively}} (for example with <code>font-size: 85%</code>) rather than {{em|absolutely}} (like <code>font-size: 8pt</code>). The resulting font size of any text should not drop below 85% of the page\'s default font size.\n\n====Color coding====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Color}}{{Shortcut|MOS:COLORCODING}}\n\nDo not use color {{em|alone}} to mark differences in text: they may be invisible to people with [[color blindness]] and useless in black-and-white printouts or displays.\n\nChoose colors such as [[maroon|<span style="background: white; color: maroon">maroon</span>]] and [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]] that are distinguishable by readers with the most common form of colorblindness, and {{em|additionally}} mark the differences with change of font or some other means ([[maroon|<span style="background: white; font-family: Georgia, serif; color: maroon; font face: Times New Roman">maroon and alternative font face</span>]], [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]]). Avoid low contrast between text and background colors. See also [[color coding]].\n\nEven for readers with unimpaired color vision, excessive background shading of table entries impedes readability and recognition of Wikilinks. Background color should be used only as a {{em|supplementary}} visual cue and should be subtle (consider using lighter, less-dominant [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] hues) rather than glaring.\n\n====Indentation<span class="anchor" id="INDENT"></span><span class="anchor" id="Indent"></span><span class="anchor" id="indenting"></span>====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:INDENT}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}}\n\nDo not use quotation templates to indent non-quotations. Various templates are available for indentation, including {{tlx|block indent}} to indent an entire block and {{tlx|in5}} to indent inline.\n\nDo not use <code>:</code> ([[description list]] markup) to indent text in articles, even though it is common on talk pages. It causes accessibility problems and outputs invalid HTML. {{Crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}} for alternatives.}}\n\n===Controlling line breaks<span id="Non-breaking spaces"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NBSP}}\n{{See also|Help:Line-break handling|Template:Spaces}}\n\nIt is sometimes desirable to force a text segment to appear entirely on a single line{{mdashb}}that is, to prevent a line break (line wrap) from occurring anywhere within it.\n*A \'\'\'[[non-breaking space]]\'\'\' (or \'\'\'hard space\'\'\') will never be used as a line-break point. Markup: for {{xt|19{{nbsp}}kg}}, code <code>19&amp;nbsp;kg</code> {{em|or}} <code>19{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>.\n*Or use {{tlx|nowrap}}, {{tlx|nobreak}}, or {{tlx|nobr}} (all equivalent). Markup: for {{xt|{{nobr|5° 24′ N}}}}, code {{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ N}}.\n\nIt is desirable to prevent line breaks where breaking across lines might be confusing or awkward. For example:\n{{columns list|colwidth=15em|\n*<code>17{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>\n*<code>AD{{t|nbsp}}565</code>\n*<code>2:50{{t|nbsp}}pm</code>\n*<code>£11{{t|nbsp}}billion</code>\n*<code>May{{t|nbsp}}2014</code>\n*{{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ 21″ N}}\n*<code>Boeing{{t|nbsp}}747</code>\n*<code>123{{t|nbsp}}Elm Street</code>\n*<code>World War{{t|nbsp}}II</code>\n*<code>Pope Paul{{t|nbsp}}VI</code>\n*<code><nowiki>\'\'</nowiki>E.{{t|nbsp}}coli<nowiki>\'\'</nowiki></code>\n}}\n\nWhether a non-breaking space is appropriate depends on context: whereas it is appropriate to use <code>12{{t|nbsp}}MB</code> in prose, it may be counterproductive in a table (where an unattractive break may be acceptable to conserve precious horizontal space) and unnecessary in a short parameter value in an infobox (where a break would never occur anyway).\n\nA line break may occur at a \'\'\'thin space\'\'\' (<code>&amp;thinsp;</code>, or {{tlx|thinsp}}), which is sometimes used to correct too-close placement of adjacent characters. To prevent this, consider using {{tlx|nobr}}.\n\nInsert non-breaking and thin spaces as [[named character reference]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;thinsp;</code>), or as templates that generate these ({{tlx|nbsp}}, {{tlx|thinsp}}), and never by entering them directly into the edit window from the keyboard{{snd}}they are visually indistinguishable from regular spaces, and later editors will be unable to see what they are. Inside wikilinks, a construction such as {{nobr|<code><nowiki>[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]</nowiki></code>}} works but {{nobr|<code>[[World War{{t|nbsp}}II]]</code>}} doesn\'t.\n\n===Scrolling lists and collapsible content===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SCROLL|MOS:COLLAPSE|MOS:DONTHIDE}}\n{{Redirect|WP:COLLAPSE|the guideline on collapsing off-topic talk page discussions|WP:TALKOFFTOPIC}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support}}\n\nElements that can selectively display or hide content can interfere with the ability of readers to access said content. These mechanisms include [[Help:Scrolling list|scrolling list]]s, and templates like {{tlx|collapse}} that can be toggled between collapsed and uncollapsed states using a {{bracket|{{midsize|hide{{\\}}show}}}} button. These mechanisms should not be used to conceal "[[Wikipedia:Spoiler|spoiler]]" information. Templates should generally [[Wikipedia:Template namespace#Guidelines|not be used to store article text]] at all, as it interferes with editors\' ability to find and edit it. Moreover, content in an article should <em>never</em> be collapsed by default. This applies equally to content in [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables|tables]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists|embedded lists]], [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Image galleries|image galleries]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Captions|image captions]].\n\nIf such mechanisms are used, care must be taken to ensure the content remains accessible for all users, including [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support|those with limited CSS or JavaScript support]]. What\'s more, careless use of collapsible templates will impact accessibility for the <em>clear majority</em> of readers (more than 60%) who use the [[Help:Mobile access|mobile version of the site]],{{efn|1=See [[Template:Navbox visibility]].}} which does not support collapsing and will either completely uncollapse or completely hide the content within the template. The usability of the mobile site is  easy to test with the "Mobile view" link at the bottom of each page.{{efn|1=The "Mobile sidebar preview" tool near the bottom of [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets]] permits live preview. The "Mobile view" page-bottom feature shows the article only as it currently exists; if using that, and considering a change that could have mobile accessibility implications, please save the change first in a [[Wikipedia:User pages#Subpages|user sandbox]] and test the mobile version of that. The mobile website can also be accessed by changing a page\'s URL from <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> to <code>en.m.wikipedia.org</code>. Note that the "desktop" version of the site being viewed on a mobile device is distinct from the <em>mobile version</em> of the site. However, checking the desktop site on a mobile device may be a worthwhile for some broader accessibility matters, especially on tablets, which do not always use the mobile version of Wikipedia.}}\n\nWhen hiding content is desired, it must be done using the <code>collapsible</code> parameter of relevant templates, or manually-added CSS classes <code>mw-collapsed</code>, and <code>autocollapse</code> (see [[Help:Collapsing]]). Other methods of hiding content should not be used, as they may render content inaccessible to many users, such as those browsing Wikipedia with [[JavaScript]] disabled, browsing the mobile version,{{efn|Collapsing content using those classes does not work in the mobile version, where such content is simply always shown. However, applying, or using a template that applies, any of the following CSS classes will cause the affected content to be inaccessible to mobile users, and this list may not be exhaustive: <code>navbox</code>, <code>mbox-image</code>, <code>vertical-navbox</code>, <code>nomobile</code> are from <code>[https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-mediawiki-config/blob/master/wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php#L17056 wgMFRemovableClasses]</code>. No top icons are displayed, so <code>topicon</code> is missing.}} or using proxy services such as [[Google Web Light]].\n\nCollapsed or auto-collapsing \'\'cells\'\' or \'\'sections\'\' may be used with tables if they simply repeat information covered in the main text (or are purely supplementary, e.g., several past years of statistics in collapsed tables for comparison with a table of uncollapsed current stats). Auto-collapsing is often a feature of [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates#Navigation templates|navboxes]]. A few [[Wikipedia:Infobox|infoboxes]] also use pre-collapsed sections for infrequently accessed details. If information in a list, infobox, or other non-navigational content seems extraneous or trivial enough to inspire pre-collapsing it, consider raising a discussion on the article (or template) talk page about whether it should be [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|included at all]]. If the information is important and the concern is article density or length, consider [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Body sections|dividing the article into more sections]], integrating [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trivia sections|unnecessarily list-formatted information]] into the article prose, or [[Wikipedia:Summary style|splitting the article]].\n\n===Invisible comments===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMENT}}\n{{redirect|WP:COMMENT|the expression of personal opinions in articles|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought}}\n{{for|invisible control characters|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Private Use Area and invisible formatting characters}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Hidden text}}\n\nEditors use "invisible" comments{{snd}}not shown in the rendered page seen by readers of the article, but visible in the source editing mode when an editor opens the article for editing{{snd}}to communicate with one another.\n\nInvisible comments are useful for alerting other editors to issues such as common mistakes that regularly occur in the article, a section title\'s being the target of an incoming link, or pointing to a discussion that established a consensus relating to the article. They should not be used to instruct other editors not to perform certain edits, which could be perceived as expressing a form of [[WP:OWN|ownership]] over an article, although where existing local consensus is against making an edit they may usefully draw the editor\'s attention to that. Avoid adding too many invisible comments because they can clutter the wiki source for other editors. Check that your invisible comment does not change the formatting, for example by introducing unwanted white space in the rendered page.\n\nTo leave an invisible comment, enclose the text you intend to be read only by editors between <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>. For example:\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;If you change this section title, also change the links to it on the pages&nbsp;...&nbsp;|wrap=yes}} {{small|(there are bots which can do this, see [[MOS:RENAMESECTION]])}}\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;When adding table entries, remember to update the total given in the text.&nbsp;|wrap=yes}}\nThis notation can be inserted with a single click in [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]], just under the edit pane in edit mode.\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation}}\n\n\'\'\'Pronunciation\'\'\' in Wikipedia is indicated in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). In most situations, for ease of understanding by the majority of readers and across variants of the language, [[Phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|quite broad]] IPA transcriptions are best for English pronunciations. See [[Help:IPA/English]] and [[Help:IPA]] (general) for keys, and {{tlx|IPA}} for templates that link to these keys. For English pronunciations, [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|pronunciation respellings]] may be used {{em|in addition to}} the IPA.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wikipedia:Editing policy|Editing policy]] –

In some older skins, a navigable table of contents appears automatically just after the lead if an article has at least four section headings.\n\nIf the topic of a section is covered in more detail in a dedicated article {{cross reference|(see [[Wikipedia:Summary style]])}}, insert {{tlx|main|{{var|Article name}}}} or {{tlx|further|{{var|Article name}}}} immediately under the section heading.\n\nAs explained in detail in {{slink|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout|Standard appendices and footers}}, several kinds of material (mostly optional) may appear after the main body of the article, in the following order:\n*Books or other works created by the subject of the article, under a section heading "Works", "Publications", "Discography", "Filmography", etc. as appropriate (avoid "Bibliography", confusable with reference citations)\n*Internal links to related English Wikipedia articles, with section heading "See also"\n*Notes and references, with a section heading "Notes" or "References" (usually the latter), or a separate section for each in this order {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]])}}; avoid "Bibliography", confusable with the subject\'s works\n*Relevant books, articles, or other publications that have not been used as sources; use the section heading "Further reading"; be highly selective, as [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a directory|Wikipedia is not a bibliographic directory]]\n*Relevant [[Wikipedia:External links|and appropriate]] websites that have not been used as sources and do not appear in the earlier appendices, using the heading "External links", which may be made a subsection of "Further reading" (or such links can be integrated directly into the "Further reading" list instead);

That advanced search does not search [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], so also check the article\'s [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] page for redirects to the old section title. If there are only a small number of links to the old section title, it may be better to just update them. }} create an [[Help:Anchor|anchor]] with that title to ensure that these still work. Similarly, when linking to a section, leave an invisible comment at the heading of the target section, naming the linking articles, so that if the heading is later altered these can be fixed. For (a combined) example:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code><nowiki>==Implications{{subst:</nowiki>[[Template:Anchor|Anchor]]<nowiki>|Consequences}}==</nowiki><br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\nwhich will be saved in the article as:\n{{block indent|1=\n{{xt|1=<code>==Implications{{code|1={{Anchor|Consequences}}}}==<br /><nowiki><!-- Section linked from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]]. --></nowiki></code>}}\n}}\n\nThe advantage of using <code><nowiki>{{subst:Anchor}}</nowiki></code>, or simply inserting the <code><nowiki><span></nowiki></code> tags directly, is that when edits are made to the section in the future, the anchor will not be included in page history entries as part of the section name. When <code><nowiki>{{Anchor}}</nowiki></code> is used directly, that undesirable behavior \'\'does\'\' occur. Note: if electing to insert the span directly, do not abbreviate it by using a self-closing tag, as in <code><nowiki>==Implications<span id="Consequences" />==</nowiki></code>, since in HTML5 that XML-style syntax is valid only for certain tags, such as {{nowrap |<code>&lt;br /></code>}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T134423 |title=T134423 Deprecate nonstandard behavior of self-closed HTML tags in wikitext. |website=phabricator.wikimedia.org |access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Avoiding broken section links}} for further discussion.\n\n====Heading-like material====\nThe above guidance about sentence case, redundancy, images, and questions also applies to [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|headers of tables]] (and of table columns and rows). However, table headings can incorporate citations and may begin with, or be, numbers. Unlike page headings, table headers do not automatically generate link anchors. Aside from sentence case in glossaries, the heading advice also applies to the \'\'term\'\' entries in [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#DLIST|description lists]]. If using [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Glossaries#Linking|template-structured glossaries]], terms will automatically have link anchors, but will not otherwise. Citations for description-list content go in the \'\'term\'\' or \'\'definition\'\' element, as needed.\n\n==National varieties of English==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ENGVAR}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Article titles#National varieties of English|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Spelling}}\n\nNational varieties of English (for example, [[American English]] or [[British English]]) differ in vocabulary (\'\'elevator\'\' vs. \'\'lift\'\'{{hairspace}}), spelling (\'\'center\'\' vs. \'\'centre\'\'), and occasionally grammar {{crossref|(see {{section link||Plurals}}, below)}}. Articles such as [[English plurals]] and [[Comparison of American and British English]] provide information about such differences. The English Wikipedia prefers no national variety over others.\n\nAn article\'s date formatting ({{xt|{{#time: F j, Y}}}} vs. {{xt|{{#time: j F Y}}}}) is also related to national varieties of English{{snd}}see [[MOS:DATEFORMAT]] and especially [[MOS:DATETIES]] and [[MOS:DATEVAR]].\n\n===Consistency within articles<span class="anchor" id="Internal consistency"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ARTCON|MOS:CONSISTENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Consistency}}\nThe conventions of a particular variety of English should be followed consistently within a given article. Exceptions include:\n*\'\'\'Quotations\'\'\' and \'\'\'titles of works\'\'\' (such as books, films, and music) should be given as they appear in sources. However, there are certain situations where this principle is not followed in order to maintain a level of typographic conformity across the encyclopedia: see {{section link||Typographic conformity}}.\n*\'\'\'Proper names\'\'\' use the subject\'s own spelling, e.g., {{xt|joint project of the United States Department of Defense and the Australian Defence Force}}; {{xt|International Labour Organization}}<!--This example is here because it uses -our and -ization at the same time; it is Oxford spelling.-->;\n*For articles about chemistry-related topics, the international standard spellings {{xt|aluminium}}, {{xt|sulfur}}, {{xt|caesium}} (and derivative terms) should be used regardless of the variety of English otherwise employed in the article. See {{section link|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)|Element names}}.\n\n===Opportunities for commonality===\n{{shortcut|MOS:COMMONALITY}}\n\nFor an international encyclopedia, using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable.\n*Use universally accepted terms rather than those less widely distributed, especially in titles. For example, [[Glasses|{{xt|glasses}}]] is preferred to the national varieties {{!xt|spectacles}} ([[British English]]) and {{!xt|eyeglasses}} ([[American English]]); [[Ten million|{{xt|ten million}}]] is preferable to [[crore|{{!xt|one crore}}]] ([[Indian English]]).\n*If a variant spelling appears in a title, make a [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirect]] page to accommodate the others, as with [[artefact]] and [[artifact]], so that all variants can be used in searches and linking.\n*Terms that differ between varieties of English, or that have divergent meanings, may be [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|glossed]] to prevent confusion, for example, {{xt|the trunk (American English) or boot (British English) of a car&nbsp;...}}.\n*Use a commonly understood word or phrase in preference to one that has a different meaning because of national differences (rather than {{!xt|alternate}}, use {{xt|alternative}} or {{xt|alternating}}, as appropriate), except in technical contexts where such substitution would be inappropriate ({{xt|alternate leaves}}; {{xt|alternate law}}).\n*When more than one variant spelling exists within a national variety of English, the most commonly used current variant should usually be preferred, except where the less common spelling has a specific usage in a specialized context, e.g., \'\'connexion\'\' in [[Connexionalism|Methodist connexionalism]].\n\n{{crossref|printworthy=y|For assistance with specific terms, see {{section link|Comparison of American and British English|Vocabulary}}, and [[American and British English spelling differences]]; most dictionaries also indicate regional terms.}}\n\n===Strong national ties to a topic===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:TIES}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Strong national ties to a topic|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Unit choice and order}}\n\nAn article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation should use the (formal, not colloquial) English of that nation. For example:\n<!--\nPlease DO NOT add more examples here. This is not a list of English dialects.\nENGVAR is concerned with English varieties that exist in a codified, formal written register with their own style guides.\n-->\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Afrikaners]] ([[South African English]])\n*[[American Civil War]] ([[American English]])\n*[[Australian Defence Force]] ([[Australian English]])\n*[[Christchurch]] ([[New Zealand English]])\n*[[Dublin]] ([[Hiberno-English]])\n*[[Great Fire of London]] ([[British English]])\n*[[Lagos]] ([[Nigerian English]])\n*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] ([[Pakistani English]])\n*[[Mumbai]] ([[Indian English]])\n*[[Vancouver]] ([[Canadian English]])\n*[[Wanchai Tower]] ([[Hong Kong English]])\n}}\n\nFor topics with strong ties to [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries and other [[British Empire|former British territories]], use [[Commonwealth English]] orthography, largely indistinguishable from British English in encyclopedic writing (excepting Canada, which uses [[Canadian English#Spelling|a different orthography]]).\n\n===Retaining the existing variety===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:RETAIN}}\n{{See also|#Retaining existing styles|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Retaining the existing format}}\n{{redirect|WP:RETAIN|the general editing policy|WP:PRESERVE|the title policy|WP:TITLEVAR}}\n\nWhen an English variety\'s [[#Consistency within articles|consistent usage]] has been established in an article, maintain it in the absence of consensus to the contrary. With few exceptions (e.g., when a topic has [[#Strong national ties to a topic|strong national ties]] or the change reduces ambiguity), there is no valid reason for changing from one acceptable option to another.\n\n{{anchor|FPSR|FMC}}When no English variety has been established and discussion does not resolve the issue, use the variety found in the first post-[[Wikipedia:Stub|stub]] revision that introduced an identifiable variety. The established variety in a given article can be documented by placing the appropriate [[:Category:Varieties of English templates|variety of English template]] on its talk page.\n\nAn article should not be edited or renamed simply to switch from one variety of English to another. {{tlxs|uw-engvar}} may be placed on an editor\'s talk page to explain this.\n\n==Capital letters==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters}}\n\nWikipedia article titles and section headings use sentence case, not title case; see [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] and {{section link||Section headings}}. For capitalization of list items, see {{section link||Bulleted and numbered lists}}. Other points concerning capitalization are summarized below. Full information can be found at [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters]]. The central point is that Wikipedia does not capitalize something unless it is consistently capitalized in a substantial majority of independent, [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]].\n\n===Capitalization of \'\'The\'\'===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of The}}\n\nGenerally, do not capitalize the word \'\'the\'\' in mid-sentence: {{xt|throughout the United Kingdom}}, not {{!xt|throughout The United Kingdom}}. Conventional exceptions include certain proper names ({{xt|he visited The Hague}}) and most titles of creative works ({{xt|Tolkien wrote \'\'The Lord of the Rings\'\'}}{{snd}}but be aware that \'\'the\'\' may not be part of the title itself, e.g., {{xt|Homer composed the \'\'Odyssey\'\'}}).\n\nThere are special considerations for: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Music#Names (definite article)|band names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Institutions|institution names]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#NICKNAMETHE|nicknames]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Indefinite and definite articles|titles of works]] &middot;&nbsp;[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trademarks#TMTHE|trademarks]].\n\n===Titles of works<span id="Capitalization-Titles"></span>===\n{{main|WP:Manual of Style/Titles of works}}\n\nThe English-language titles of compositions (books and other print works, songs and other audio works, films and other visual media works, paintings and other artworks, etc.) are given in {{em|[[title case]]}}, in which every word is given an initial capital except for certain less important words (as detailed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters|Composition titles}}). The first and last words in an English-language title are always capitalized.\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'An Eye for an Eye\'\'}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|\'\'Worth the Fighting For\'\'}}\n\nCapitalization in non-English language titles varies, even over time within the same language; generally, retain the style of the original for modern works, and follow the usage in current{{efn|name=recent}} English-language reliable sources for historical works. When written in the Latin alphabet, many of these items should also be in [[#Italics|italics]], or enclosed in [[#Names and titles|quotation marks]].\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}\n*{{em|Correct:}} {{xt|"{{lang|de|italics=no|Hymnus an den heiligen Geist}}"}}\n\n===Titles of people===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Titles of people}}\n*\'\'\'In generic use\'\'\', use lower case for words such as \'\'president\'\', \'\'king\'\', and \'\'emperor\'\' ({{xt|De Gaulle was a French president}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was a French king}}; {{xt|Three prime ministers attended the conference}}).\n*\'\'\'Directly before the person\'s name\'\'\', such words begin with a capital letter ({{xt|President Obama}}, not {{!xt|president Obama}}). Standard or commonly used names of an office are treated as proper names ({{xt|David Cameron was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom}}; {{xt|Hirohito was Emperor of Japan}}; {{xt|Louis XVI was King of France}}). Royal styles take capitals ({{xt|Her Majesty}}; {{xt|His Highness}}); exceptions may apply for particular offices.\n\n===Religions, deities, philosophies, doctrines===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Religions, deities, philosophies, doctrines, and their adherents}}\n{{see|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Religion}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Religious texts}}\n*\'\'\'Religions, sects, and churches\'\'\' and their followers (in noun or adjective form) start with a capital letter. Generally, "the" is not capitalized before such names ({{xt|the Unitarians}}, not {{!xt|The Unitarians}}).\n*\'\'\'[[Religious text]]s\'\'\' are capitalized, but often not italicized ({{xt|the Bhagavad Gita}}, {{xt|the Quran}}, {{xt|the Talmud}}, {{xt|the Granth Sahib}}, {{xt|the Bible}}). Do not capitalize "the" when using it in this way. Some derived adjectives are capitalized by convention, and some are not ({{xt|biblical}}, but {{xt|Quranic}}); if unsure, check a dictionary.\n*\'\'\'[[Honorific]]s for deities\'\'\', including proper names and titles, start with a capital letter ({{xt|God}}, {{xt|Allah}}, {{xt|the Lord}}, {{xt|the Supreme Being}}, {{xt|the Great Spirit}}, {{xt|the Horned One}}, {{xt|Bhagavan}}). Do not capitalize "the" in such cases or when referring to major religious figures or characters from mythology ({{xt|the Prophet}}, {{xt|the Messiah}}, {{xt|the Virgin}}). Common nouns for deities and religious figures are not capitalized ({{xt|many gods}}; {{xt|the god Woden}}; {{xt|saints and prophets}}).\n*\'\'\'Pronouns for figures of veneration or worship\'\'\' are not capitalized, even if capitalized in a religion\'s scriptures ({{xt|God and his will}}).\n*\'\'\'Broad categories of mythical or legendary beings\'\'\' start with lower-case letters ({{xt|elf}}, {{xt|fairy}}, {{xt|nymph}}, {{xt|unicorn}}, {{xt|angel}}), although in works of fantasy, such as the novels of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and some video games, initial capitals are sometimes used to indicate that the beings form a culture or race in a [[fictional universe]]. Capitalize the names or titles of individual creatures ({{xt|the Minotaur}}, {{xt|Pegasus}}) and of groups whose name and membership are fixed ({{xt|the Magi, or the Three Wise Men}}, {{xt|the Furies}}). Generalized references are not capitalized ({{xt|these priests}}; {{xt|several wise men}}; {{xt|cherub-like}}).\n*\'\'\'Spiritual or religious events\'\'\' are capitalized only when referring to specific incidents or periods ({{xt|the Great Flood}} and {{xt|the Exodus}}; but {{xt|annual flooding}} and {{xt|an exodus of refugees}}).\n*\'\'\'Philosophies, theories, movements, and doctrines\'\'\' use lower case unless the name derives from a proper name ({{xt|capitalism versus Marxism}}) or has become a proper name ({{xt|republican}}, a system of political thought; {{xt|Republican}}, a political party). Use lower case for doctrinal topics or canonical religious ideas (as opposed to specific events), even if they are capitalized by some religious adherents ({{xt|virgin birth}}, {{xt|original sin}}, {{xt|transubstantiation}}).\n*\'\'\'[[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] or transcendent ideals\'\'\' are capitalized in the context of philosophical doctrine ({{xt|Truth}}, {{xt|the Good}}); used more broadly, they are in lower case ({{xt|Superman represents American ideals of truth and justice}}).

Higher taxa (order, family, etc.) are capitalized in Latin ({{xt|Carnivora}}, {{xt|Felidae}}) but not in their English equivalents ({{xt|carnivorans}}, {{xt|felids}}); they are not italicized in either form, except for viruses, where all names accepted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]] are italicized ({{xt|\'\'Retroviridae\'\'}}).\n\n\'\'\'[[Cultivar]]\'\'\' and \'\'\'[[cultivar group]]\'\'\' names of plants are not italicized, and are capitalized (including the word \'\'Group\'\' in the name); cultivar names appear within single quotes ({{xt|\'\'Malus domestica\'\' \'Red Delicious\'}}), while cultivar groups do not ({{xt|\'\'Cynara cardunculus\'\' Scolymus Group}}).\n\n\'\'\'English [[Common name|vernacular ("common") names]]\'\'\' are given in lower case in article prose ([[Plains zebra|{{xt|plains zebra}}]]<!-- animal species -->, [[Mountain maple|{{xt|mountain&nbsp;maple}}]]<!-- plant species -->, and [[Southwestern red-tailed hawk|{{xt|southwestern red-tailed hawk}}]]<!-- bird subspecies -->) and in sentence case at the start of sentences and in other places where the first letter of the first word is capitalized.{{efn|name=Sentence case}} They are additionally capitalized where they contain proper names: [[Przewalski\'s horse|{{xt|Przewalski\'s&nbsp;horse}}]]<!-- eponym -->, [[California condor|{{xt|California&nbsp;condor}}]]<!-- typical geonym -->, and [[Fair-maid-of-France|{{xt|fair-maid-of-France}}]]<!-- unusual but important illustrative case -->.

"Standardized breed" lacks a perfectly clear meaning, but does encompass any breed subject to the [[breed standard]] or [[studbook]] of a notable breeder/fancier organization. Various other groupings of domesticated animals are not standardized breeds: ancient historical varieties, breed groups, feral populations, landraces, and [[crossbreed]]s or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] that no major organizations recognize as breeds. Many often are not [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] anyway.}} Examples: [[German Shepherd|{{xt|German Shepherd}}]], [[Russian White goat|{{xt|Russian White goat}}]], [[Berlin Short-faced Tumbler|{{xt|Berlin Short-faced Tumbler}}]]. As with plant cultivars, this applies whether or not the included noun is a proper name, in contrast to how vernacular names of species are written. However, unlike cultivars, breeds are never put in single quotation marks, and their names are never part of a scientific name. A species term appended at the end for disambiguation ("cat", "hound", "horse", "swine", etc.) should not be capitalized, unless it is a part of the breed name itself and is consistently presented that way in the breed standards (rare cases include [[Norwegian Forest Cat|{{xt|Norwegian Forest Cat}}]] and [[American Quarter Horse|{{xt|American Quarter Horse}}]]).\n\nCreate [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]] from alternative capitalization and spelling forms of article titles, and from alternative names, e.g., [[Adélie Penguin]], [[Adelie penguin]], [[Adelie Penguin]] and \'\'[[Pygoscelis adeliae]]\'\' should all redirect to [[Adélie penguin]].\n\n===Celestial bodies===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Celestial bodies}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (astronomical objects)}}\nThe words \'\'sun\'\', \'\'earth\'\', \'\'moon\'\' and \'\'solar system\'\' do not take capitals in general use ({{xt|The sun was over the mountain top}}; {{xt|The tribal people thought of the whole earth as their home}}). They are capitalized when the entity is personified ({{xt|Sol Invictus (\'Unconquered Sun\') was the Roman sun god}}) or when used as the name of a specific body in a scientific or astronomical context ({{xt|The Moon orbits the Earth}}; but {{xt|Io is a moon of Jupiter}}).\n\nNames of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, stars, constellations, and galaxies are proper names, and therefore capitalized ({{xt|The planet Mars is in the constellation Gemini, near the star Pollux}}). The first letter of every word in such a name is capitalized ({{xt|Alpha Centauri}} and not {{!xt|Alpha centauri}}; {{xt|Milky Way}}, not {{!xt|Milky way}}). Words such as \'\'comet\'\' and \'\'galaxy\'\' should be capitalized when they form part of a proper name, but not when they are used as a generic term ({{xt|Halley\'s Comet is the most famous of the comets}}; {{xt|The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy}}).\n\n===Compass points<span class="anchor" id="Compass"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Compass points}}\n\nDo not capitalize \'\'\'directions\'\'\' such as \'\'north\'\', or their related forms ({{xt|We took the northern road}}), except where they are parts of proper names ({{xt|Great North Road}}, {{xt|Great Western Drive}}, {{xt|South Pole}}).\n\nCapitalize \'\'\'names of regions\'\'\' if they have attained proper-name status, including informal conventional names ({{xt|Southern California}}; {{xt|the Western Desert}}), and derived terms for people (e.g., a \'\'Southerner\'\' as someone from the [[Southern United States]]). Do not capitalize descriptive names for regions that have not attained the status of proper names, such as {{xt|southern Poland}}.\n\nComposite directions may or may not be hyphenated, depending on the [[#National varieties of English|variety of English adopted]] in the article. {{xt|Southeast Asia}} and {{xt|northwest}} are more common in American English; but {{xt|South-East Asia}} and {{xt|north-west}} in British English. In cases such as {{xt|north–south dialogue}} and {{xt|east–west orientation}}, use an en dash; see {{section link||En dashes: other uses}}.\n\n===Proper names versus generic terms<span id="Institutions"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Institutions|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Capitalization of \'\'The\'\'}}\n\nCapitalize names of particular institutions ({{xt|the founding of the University of Delhi}};{{nbsp}} {{xt|the history of Stanford University}}) but not generic words for institutions ({{xt|the high school is near the university}}). Do not capitalize \'\'the\'\' at the start of an institution\'s name, regardless of the institution\'s preferred style. There are rare exceptions, when a leading \'\'The\'\' is represented by a \'\'T\'\' in the organization\'s acronym: {{xt|The International Cat Association (TICA)}}.\n\nTreat political or geographic units similarly: {{xt|The city has a population of 55,000}};{{nbsp}} {{xt|The two towns merged to become the City of Smithville}}. Do not mimic the style of local newspapers which refer to their municipality as \'\'the City\'\' or \'\'The City\'\'; an exception is the [[City of London]], referred to as {{xt|the City}} in a context that already makes the subject clear, as distinct from [[London]] and [[Greater London]]. When in doubt, use the full name for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]] reasons; users of text-to-speech systems usually cannot hear a difference between \'\'city\'\' and \'\'City\'\'.\n\n==Ligatures==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)#Modified letters}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LIG|MOS:LIGATURE}}\n\n[[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] should be used in languages in which they are standard (hence {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'œil\'\'}} is preferable to {{xt|Moreau\'s last words were \'\'clin d\'oeil\'\'}}) but not in English ({{xt|encyclopedia}} or {{xt|encyclopaedia}}, not {{!xt|encyclopædia}}), except in proper names ({{xt|Æthelstan}}, not {{!xt|Aethelstan}}).\n\n==Abbreviations<span class="anchor" id="Acronyms and abbreviations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Acronyms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Initialisms"></span><span class="anchor" id="Shortenings"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations}}\n{{see also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Initials}}\n\nAbbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. In strict analysis, they are distinct from [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], which use an [[apostrophe]] (e.g., \'\'won\'t\'\', see {{Section link||Contractions}}), and [[initialism]]s. An initialism is formed from some or all of the initial letters of words in a phrase. Below, references to abbreviations should be taken to include acronyms, and the term \'\'acronym\'\' to apply also to initialisms.\n\n===Write first occurrences in full===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:1STOCC|MOS:1STABBR}}\n\nWhen an abbreviation will be used in an article, first introduce it using the full expression:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|an early local area network (LAN) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC){{nbsp}}... DEC\'s later LAN products were{{nbsp}}...}}}}\n\nDo not use capitals in the full version merely because capitals are used in the abbreviation: {{!xt|an early Local Area Network (LAN)}}.\n\nExcept in special circumstances, common abbreviations (such as {{xt|PhD}}, {{xt|DNA}}, {{xt|USSR}}) need not be expanded even on first use.\n\n===Plural forms===\nPluralize [[acronyms]] by adding \'\'-s\'\' or \'\'-es\'\': {{xt|Three CD-ROMs and two BIOSes were released}}. Do not [[Apostrophe#Abbreviations|use apostrophes to form plurals]]: {{!xt|Three CD-ROM\'s and two BIOS\'s were released}}.\n\n===Punctuation and spacing<span class="anchor" id="Periods (full stops) and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="Full stops and spaces"></span><span class="anchor" id="op.cit."></span>===\nAn abbreviation may or may not be terminated with a full point (also called a \'\'period\'\' or \'\'full stop\'\'). A consistent style should be maintained within an article. North American usage is typically to end all abbreviations with a period/point ({{xt|Dr. Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St.}}) but in common British and Australian usage, no period/point is used if the abbreviation (contraction) ends in the last letter of the unabbreviated form ({{xt|Dr Smith of 42&nbsp;Drummond St}}) unless confusion could result. This is also common practice in scientific writing. Regardless of punctuation, words that are abbreviated to more than one letter are spaced ({{xt|op.&nbsp;cit.}} not {{!xt|op.cit.}} or {{!xt|opcit}}). There are some exceptions: {{xt|PhD}} {{crossref|(see above)}} for "Philosophiae Doctor"; {{xt|BVetMed}} for "Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine". In most situations, Wikipedia uses no such punctuation inside acronyms and initialisms: {{xt|GDP}}, not {{!xt|G.D.P.}}\n\n===US and U.S.<span class="anchor" id="US"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S."></span><span class="anchor" id="USA"></span><span class="anchor" id="U.S.A."></span>===\n{{redirect|MOS:US|the use of the word "us"|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#First-person pronouns}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:US|MOS:USA|MOS:NOTUSA}}\n{{xt|US}} is a commonly used abbreviation for {{xt|United States}}, although {{xtn|U.S.}} – with periods and without a space – remains common in North American publications, including in news journalism.  Multiple American style guides, including \'\'[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]\'\' (since 2010), now deprecate "U.S." and recommend "US".\n\nFor [[#Opportunities for commonality|commonality]] reasons, use {{xt|US}} by default when abbreviating, but [[#Retaining existing styles|retain]] {{xtn|U.S.}} in American or Canadian English articles in which it is already established, unless there is a good reason to change it. Because use of periods for abbreviations and acronyms should be consistent within any given article, use {{xt|US}} in an article with other country abbreviations, and especially avoid constructions like {{!xt|the U.S. and the UK}}. In longer abbreviations that incorporate the country\'s initials ({{xt|USN}}, {{xt|USAF}}), never use periods. When the United States is mentioned with one or more other countries in the same sentence, {{xt|US}} (or {{xtn|U.S.}}) may be too informal, especially at the first mention or as a noun instead of an adjective ({{xt|France and the United States}}, not {{!xt|France and the US}}). Do not use the spaced {{!xt|U.&nbsp;S.}} or the archaic {{!xt|U.S.&nbsp;of&nbsp;A.}}, except when quoting. Do not use {{!xt|U.S.A.}} or {{!xt|USA}} except in a quotation, as part of a proper name ({{xt|Team USA}}), or in certain technical and formal uses (e.g., the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]], [[FIFA country codes|FIFA]], and [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country codes]]).\n\n===Circa===\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Uncertain, incomplete, or approximate dates}} for examples.}}\n\nTo indicate \'\'approximately\'\', the use of {{tlx|circa}}, showing as {{circa}}, is preferred over circa, c., ca., or approx.\n\n===Avoid unwarranted use===\n<span class="anchor" id="unwarranted abbreviations"></span>\n{{Hatnote|See also: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Units of measurement}} for when to abbreviate units of measurement.}}\n\nAvoid abbreviations when they might confuse the reader, interrupt the flow, or appear informal. For example:\n*Do not use {{!xt|approx.}} for {{xt|approximate(ly)}} except in an infobox or table (in which case use {{tlx|abbr|approx.|approximately}} at first occurrence: {{xt|{{abbr|approx.|approximately}}}}).\n*Do not use the legalism {{!xt|Smith J}} for {{xt|Justice Smith}}. <!-- this might be better in [[WP:JARGON]] -->\n\n===Do not invent===\nAvoid devising [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary#Neologisms|new abbreviations]], especially acronyms. For example, {{xtn|World Union of Billiards}} is good as a {{em|translation}} of {{xt|[[Union Mondiale de Billard]]}}, but neither it nor the reduction {{!xt|WUB}} is used by the organization or by independent sources; use the original name and its official abbreviation, {{xt|UMB}}.\n\nIf it is necessary to abbreviate in a tight space, such as a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables#Captions and headers|column header in a table]], use widely recognized abbreviations. For example, for {{xt|New Zealand gross national product}}, use {{xt|NZ}} and {{xt|GNP}}, with a link if the term has not already been written out in the article: {{xt|NZ&nbsp;[[Measures of national income and output|GNP]]}}. Do not make up initialisms such as {{!xt|NZGNP}}.\n\n===HTML tags and templates===\nEither {{tag|abbr|o}} or {{tlx|abbr}} can be used for abbreviations and acronyms: {{tag|abbr|params=title="World Health Organization"|content=WHO|wrap=yes}} or {{tlx|abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}} will generate {{abbr|WHO|World Health Organization}}; [[mouseover|hovering]] over the rendered text causes a [[tooltip]] of the long form to pop up.\n\n===Ampersand===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:AMP|MOS:&}}\n\nIn normal text and headings, use \'\'and\'\' instead of the [[ampersand]] (\'\'&\'\'): {{xt|January 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2}}, not {{!xt|January 1&nbsp;&&nbsp;2}}. But retain an ampersand when it is a legitimate part of the style of a proper noun, the title of a work, or a trademark, such as in \'\'[[Up & Down (Horace Parlan album)|Up&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Down]]\'\' or [[AT&T]]. Elsewhere, ampersands may be used with consistency and discretion where space is extremely limited (e.g., tables and infoboxes). Quotations [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Typographic conformity|may be cautiously modified]], especially for consistency where different editions are quoted, as modern editions of old texts routinely replace ampersands with \'\'and\'\' (just as they replace other disused [[glyph]]s, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and abbreviations). Another frequent permissible but not required use is in short bibliographic references to works by multiple authors, e.g.: {{xt|<nowiki><ref>Lubbers & Scheepers (2002); Van Hiel & Mervielde (2002); Swyngedouw & Giles (2007); Van Hiel (2012).</ref></nowiki>}}.\n\n==Italics==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IT|MOS:ITAL}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Italic type}}\n\n===Emphasis<span id="Do not use capitals for emphasis"></span>===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Emphasis}}\n\nItalics are used for emphasis, rather than [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Boldface|boldface]] or [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#All caps and small caps|capitals]]. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.\n\nUse {{tag|em}} or {{tlx|em|...}} for emphasis.

When a whole sentence is mentioned, double quotation marks may be used instead, with consistency ({{xt|The preposition in \'\'She sat on the chair\'\' is \'\'on\'\'}}; or {{xt|The preposition in "She sat on the chair" is "on"}}). Quotation marks may also be used for shorter material to avoid confusion, such as when italics are already heavily used in the page for another purpose (e.g., for many non-English words and phrases). {{em|Mentioning}} (to discuss grammar, wording, punctuation, etc.) is different from {{em|quoting}} (in which something is usually expressed on behalf of a quoted source). Quotation is done with quotation marks, never italics, nor both at once {{crossref|(see {{section link||Quotations}} for details).}}\n\nA closely related use of italics is when introducing or distinguishing terms: {{xt|The \'\'natural numbers\'\' are the integers greater than 0.}}\n\n===Non-English words <span class="anchor" id="Foreign words"></span> ===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English terms}}\nItalics are indicated for non-English phrases and isolated non-English words that are not commonly used in everyday English.

These are alterations which make no difference when the text is read aloud, for example:\n\n*Normalize dashes and hyphens: see {{Section link||Dashes}}. Use the style chosen for the article: unspaced [[em dash]] or spaced [[en dash]].\n*Convert apostrophes and quotation marks to Wikipedia\'s style:\n**These should be straight, not curly or slanted. See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.\n**When quoting a quotation that itself contains a quotation, alternate between using double and single quotes for each quotation. See {{section link||For a quotation within a quotation}} for details.\n*When quoting text from non-English languages, the outer punctuation should follow [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation marks|the Manual of Style for English quote marks]]. If there are nested quotations, follow the rules for correct punctuation in that language. If there are multiple styles for a language, the one used by the Wikipedia for that language is preferred unless the punctuation itself is under discussion.\n*:{{xt|The cynical response "{{lang|fr|italic=unset|L\'auteur aurait dû demander&nbsp;: «&nbsp;à quoi sert-il d\'écrire ceci&nbsp;?&nbsp;» mais ne l\'a pas fait}}" was all he wrote.}}\n*Remove spaces before punctuation such as periods and colons.\n*Generally preserve bold and italics {{cross reference|(see {{section link||Italics}})}}, but most other styling should be altered. {{!xt|{{Underline|Underlining}}}}, {{!xt|spac&nbsp;ing}} within words, {{!xt|1=co<span style="color:Goldenrod;">lor</span>s}}, {{!xt|ALL CAPS}}, {{Smallcaps|{{!xt|small caps}}}}, etc. should generally be normalized to plain text. If it {{em|clearly}} indicates emphasis, use italic {{em|emphasis}} ({{tlx|em}}) or, in an already-italic passage, boldface (with {{tlx|strong}}). For titles of books, articles, poems, and so forth, use italics or quotation marks following [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles|the guidance for titles]]. Italics can also be added to mark up [[#Non-English term|non-English terms]] (with the {{tlx|lang}} template), for an [[#Animals, plants, and other organisms|organism\'s scientific name]], and to indicate a [[#Words as words|words-as-words]] usage.\n*Expand an abbreviation (not already used in the content before the quotation) as a square-bracketed change, or explain it using {{tlx|abbr}}.\n*Normalize archaic glyphs and ligatures in English that are unnecessary to the meaning. Examples include \'\'[[æ]]\'\'→\'\'ae\'\', \'\'[[œ]]\'\'→\'\'oe\'\', \'\'[[Long s|ſ]]\'\'→\'\'s\'\', and \'\'[[Thorn (letter)#Abbreviations|þ<sup>e</sup>]]\'\'→\'\'the\'\'. {{crossref|(See also {{section link||Ampersand}}.)}}\n\n{{crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Typographic conformity}} for special considerations in normalizing the typography of titles of works.}}\n\nHowever, national varieties should not be changed, as these may involve changes in vocabulary. For example, a quotation from a British source should retain British spelling, even in an article that otherwise uses American spelling. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Consistency within articles}}.)}} Numbers also usually [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Quotations, titles, etc.|should not be reformatted]].\n\nDirect quotation should not be used to preserve the formatting preferred by an external publisher (especially when the material would otherwise be unchanged), as this tends to have the effect of [[Scare quotes|scare-quoting]]:\n*{{em|Acceptable}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n*{{em|Unacceptable}}: {{!xt|The animal is listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nItalics can be used to mark a particular usage as a [[term of art]] (a case of "[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words as words]]"), especially when it is unfamiliar or should not be reworded by a non-expert:\n*{{em|Permissible}}: {{xt|The animal is listed as \'\'critically endangered\'\' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.}}\n\nWhen quoting a complete sentence, it is usually recommended to keep the first word capitalized. However, if the quoted passage has been integrated into the surrounding sentence (for example, with an introduction such as "{{var|X}} said that"), the original capital letter may be lower-cased.\n*{{xt|LaVesque\'s report stated: "The equipment was selected for its low price.

The source must be named {{em|in article text}} if the quotation is an opinion {{Crossreference|(see {{Section link|Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Attributing and specifying biased statements}})}}. When attributing a quotation, avoid [[Wikipedia:Words to avoid#Synonyms for said|characterizing it in a biased manner]].\n\n===Quotations within quotations===\nSee {{section link||For a quotation within a quotation}}.\n\n===Linking===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:LINKQUOTE|MOS:LWQ}}\n\nBe conservative when linking within quotations; link only to targets that correspond to the meaning clearly intended by the quote\'s author. Where possible, link from text outside of the quotation instead – either before it or soon after. (If quoting [[hypertext]], add an editorial note, {{xt|[link in original]}} or {{xt|[link added]}}, as appropriate, to avoid ambiguity as to whether the link was made by the original author.)\n\n===Block quotations<span class="anchor" id="Block quotations"></span><span class="anchor" id="Block quotes"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:BQ|MOS:BLOCKQUOTE}}\n\nFormat a long quote (more than about forty words or a few hundred characters, or consisting of more than one paragraph, regardless of length) as a [[block quotation]], indented on both sides. Block quotations should be enclosed in {{tlx|blockquote}}.\n\nDo not enclose block quotations in quotation marks (and especially avoid large, decorative quotation marks; those provided by the {{tlx|cquote}} template have been disabled in mainspace). Block quotations using a colored background are also discouraged.\n\nUse {{tnull|blockquote}} and so on only for actual quotations; [[#Indentation|indentation for other purposes]] is done differently.\n\nIt is conventional to precede a block quotation with an introductory sentence (or sentence fragment) and append the source citation to that line. Alternatively, the {{tnull|blockquote}} template provides parameters for attribution and citation which will appear below the quotation. {{Crossref|(For use of dashes with attributions, see {{section link||Other uses for em dashes}}.)}} This below-quotation attribution style is intended for famous quotations and is unusual in articles because it may strike an inappropriate tone. A quotation with no cited source should be flagged with {{tlx|quote without source}}, or deleted.\n\nLine breaks and indentation inside a {{tnull|blockquote}} or {{tag|blockquote|o}} are generally ignored; use {{xtag|poem}} or {{tlx|poem quote}} for poetry, lyrics, and similar material:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">\n{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis gives:\n{{xt|{{blockquote|<poem>\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\n</poem>}}}}\n\nOr quote such material inline, with line breaks indicated by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}/</nowiki></code>, and paragraph or stanza breaks by <code><nowiki>{{nbsp}}//</nowiki></code>.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:PQ|MOS:PULLQUOTE}}\n{{Anchor|Pull quotes|Pull quote|Pull quotations|nocquote|reason=The old name of Template:Pull_quote was Template:Cquote, and "nocquote" was historically used to refer to this MOS section, which now has its own shortcuts.}}\n[[Pull quote]]s do not belong in Wikipedia articles.

Quotations that are translations should be explicitly distinguished from those that are not. Indicate the original source of a translation (if it is available, and not first published within Wikipedia), and the original language (if that is not clear from the context).\n\nIf the original, untranslated text is available, provide a reference for it or include it, as appropriate.\n\nWhen editors themselves translate text into English, care must always be taken to include the original text, {{em|in italics}} (except for non-Latin-based writing systems, and best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template which both italicizes as appropriate and provides language metadata); and to use actual and (if at all possible) common English words in the translation.

(Some people are left-handed, but that does not make right-handed people "better" than left-handed people.)}}\n\nThere should be a space after a closing bracket, except where a punctuation mark follows (though a spaced dash would still be spaced after a closing bracket) and in unusual cases similar to those listed for opening brackets.\n\nAvoid adjacent sets of brackets. Either put the parenthetical phrases in one set separated by semicolons, or rewrite:\n*{{em|Avoid}}: {{!xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) (also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919; also known as Matvii Hryhoriiv) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.}}\n*{{em|Better}}: {{xt|Nikifor Grigoriev ({{circa|1885}}&nbsp;– 1919) was a Ukrainian insurgent leader.

They serve three main purposes:\n*To clarify: {{xt|She attended [secondary] school}}, where this was the intended meaning, but the type of school was unstated in the original sentence.\n*To reduce the size of a quotation: {{xt|X contains Y, and under certain circumstances, X may contain Z as well}} may be reduced to {{xt|X contains Y [and sometimes Z]}}. When an ellipsis ({{xt|...}}) is used to indicate that material is removed from a direct quotation, it should not normally be bracketed. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Ellipses}} for an exceptional case.)}}\n*To make the grammar work: Referring to someone\'s statement {{xt|"I hate to do laundry"}}, one could properly write {{xt|She "hate[s] to do laundry"}}.\n\nIf a sentence includes subsidiary material enclosed in square or round brackets, it must still carry terminal punctuation {{em|after}} those brackets, regardless of any punctuation within the brackets. {{Block indent|{{xt|She refused all requests (except for basics such as food, medicine, etc.).}}}} However, if the entire sentence is within brackets, the closing punctuation falls within the brackets. {{xt|(This sentence is an example.)}}\n\n====Brackets and linking====\nSquare brackets inside of links must be [[Escape character|escaped]]:\n\n{| class="wikitable"\n| He said, "<code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[[John Doe|John &amp;#91;Doe&amp;#93;]]</nowiki>}}</code> answered." ||\nHe said, "[[John Doe|John &#91;Doe&#93;]] answered."\n|-\n| He said, "<code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[[John Doe|John {{bracket|Doe}}]]</nowiki>}}</code> answered." ||\nHe said, "[[John Doe|John {{bracket|Doe}}]] answered."\n|-\n| <code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[https://example.com On the first day &amp;#91;etc.&amp;#93;]</nowiki>}}</code> ||\n[https://example.com On the first day &#91;etc.&#93;]\n|-\n| <code>{{mxt|<nowiki>[https://example.com On the first day {{bracket|etc.}}]</nowiki>}}</code> ||\n[https://example.com On the first day {{bracket|etc.}}]\n|}\n\nThe {{xtag|nowiki}} markup can also be used: {{tag|nowiki|content=[Doe]}} or {{tag|nowiki|content=[etc.]}}.\n\nIf a URL itself contains square brackets, the wiki-text should use the [[URL encoding|URL-encoded]] form <code><nowiki>https://</nowiki>example.com/foo.php?query={{bxt|%5B}}xxx{{bxt|%5D}}yyy</code>, rather than&nbsp;...<code>query={{!bxt|&#91;}}xxx{{!bxt|&#93;}}yyy</code>.

Serial commas are more helpful when article text is complex, such as a list with multi-word items (especially if one contains its own "\'\'and\'\'"{{--)}} or a series of probably unfamiliar terms.\n\nHowever, there are cases in which either omitting or including the serial comma results in ambiguity:\n\n{{Block indent|{{!xt|The author thanked her friends, Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley}} {{spnd}}which may list either four or more people (the friends and the two people named) or two people (O\'Connor and Marley, who are the friends).}}\n\n{{Block indent|{{!xt|The author thanked a friend, Sinéad O\'Connor, and Bob Marley}} {{spnd}}which may list either two people (O\'Connor, who is the friend, and Marley) or three people (the first being the friend, the second O\'Connor, and the third Marley).}}\n\nIn such cases of ambiguity, clarify one of four ways:\n*Add or remove the serial comma.\n*Use separate sentences, bullet lists, or some other structural change to clarify.\n*Recast the sentence ("friends" case):\n**To list two people: {{xt|The author thanked her friends Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley.}}\n***Clearer: {{xt|The author thanked two friends – Sinéad O\'Connor and Bob Marley.}}\n**To list several people:\n**: {{xt|The author thanked Sinéad O\'Connor, Bob Marley and her friends}} or\n**: {{xt|The author thanked Sinéad O\'Connor, Bob Marley, and her friends}}.\n***But not: {{!xt|The author thanked Bob Marley, Sinéad O\'Connor[,] and her friends}} {{spnd}}introduces ambiguity about \'\'her\'\'.\n*Recast the sentence ("friend" case):\n**To list two people: {{xt|The author thanked Bob Marley and her friend, Sinéad O\'Connor.}}\n***Or be more specific when possible (the commas here set off non-restrictive [[Apposition|appositives]]): {{xt|The author thanked her childhood friend, Sinéad O\'Connor, and her mentor, Bob Marley.}}\n**To list three people: {{xt|The author thanked Bob Marley, Sinéad O\'Connor, and a friend.}}\n***Clarity with gender-specific terms such as \'\'mother\'\' can be tricky; {{!xt|The author thanked her mother, Kim Thayil, and Sinéad O\'Connor}} is unclear because readers may not know [[Kim Thayil]] is male and wouldn\'t be the same person as the mother.\n***Clearer: {{xt|The author thanked Kim Thayil, Sinéad O\'Connor, and her own mother}} or {{xt|The author thanked her mother and musicians Kim Thayil and Sinéad O\'Connor}}.\n\n===Colons===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COLON}}\n{{For|the "colon trick" (for linking to a category, image, or interwiki link without adding the page to the category, displaying the image, or adding the interwiki link)|Help:Colon trick}}\n\nA [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] ({{xt|:}}) introduces something that demonstrates, explains, or modifies what has come before, or is a list of items that has just been introduced. The items in such a list may be separated by commas, or if they are more complex and perhaps themselves contain commas, the items should be separated by semicolons or arranged in a bulleted list.\n\n{{Block indent|{{xt|We visited several tourist attractions: the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which I thought could fall at any moment; the Bridge of Sighs; the supposed birthplace of Petrarch, or at least the first known house in which he lived; and so many more.}}}}\n\nA colon may also be used to introduce [[Quotation marks in English#Quotations and speech|direct speech]] enclosed within quotation marks. {{crossref|(See {{section link||Quotation marks}}.)}}\n\nIn most cases, a colon works best with a complete grammatical sentence before it. When what follows the colon is also a complete sentence, start it with a capital letter, but otherwise do not capitalize after a colon except where doing so is needed for another reason, such as for a proper name. When a colon is being used as a separator in an article title, section heading, or list item, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\nExcept in technical usage ({{xt|a 3:1 ratio}}), no sentence should contain multiple colons, no space should precede a colon, and a space (but never a hyphen or dash) should follow the colon.\n\n===Semicolons===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SEMICOLON|MOS:COMMASPLICE|MOS:;}}\n{{for|usage in marking up description (definition) lists|Help:List#Description lists}}\n\nA [[semicolon]] ({{xt|;}}) is sometimes an alternative to a full stop (period), enabling related material to be kept in the same sentence; it marks a more decisive division in a sentence than a comma. If the semicolon separates clauses, normally each clause must be independent (meaning that it could stand on its own as a sentence). In many cases, only a comma or only a semicolon will be correct in a given sentence.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Though he had been here before, I did not recognize him.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Though he had been here before; I did not recognize him.}}\n|}\n\nAbove, "Though he had been here before" cannot stand on its own as a sentence, and therefore is not an independent clause.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Correct:}}\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Incorrect:}}\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are classified as alkaline.}}\n|}\n\nThis incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses is known as a [[comma splice]]; however, in certain kinds of cases, a comma may be used where a semicolon would seem to be called for:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"Life is short, art is long."}} (two brief clauses in an [[aphorism]]; see \'\'[[Ars longa, vita brevis]]\'\')\n|-\n| {{em|Accepted}}: || {{xt|"I have studied it, you have not."}} (reporting brisk conversation, such as this reply of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\'s)\n|}\n\nA sentence may contain several semicolons, especially when the clauses are parallel in construction and meaning; multiple unrelated semicolons are often signs that the sentence should be divided into shorter sentences or otherwise refashioned.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Unwieldy}}:\n| {{!xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit; bananas are classified as alkaline; pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Better}}:\n| {{xt|Oranges are an acidic fruit, bananas are alkaline, and pears are close to neutral; these distinctions are rarely discussed.}}\n|}\n\nSemicolons are used in addition to commas to separate items in a listing, when commas alone would result in confusion.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Confusing}}:\n| {{!xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts, San Francisco, California, Singapore, and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|-\n| style="padding-right:1em" | {{em|Clear}}:\n| {{xt|Sales offices are located in Boston, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Singapore; and Millbank, London, England.}}\n|}\n\n====Semicolon before "however"====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HOWEVER}}\n\nThe meaning of a sentence containing a trailing clause that starts with the word \'\'however\'\' depends on the punctuation preceding that word. A common error is to use the wrong punctuation, thereby changing the meaning to one not intended.\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is an adverb meaning "nevertheless", it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; however, they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people; nevertheless, they tried.}}\n|}\n\nWhen the word \'\'however\'\' is a conjunction meaning "in whatever manner", or "regardless of how", it may be preceded by a comma but not by a semicolon, and should not be followed by punctuation. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, however they tried.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|It was obvious they could not convert these people, regardless of how they tried.}}\n|}\n\nIn the first case, the clause that starts with "however" cannot be swapped with the first clause; in the second case this can be done without change of meaning:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|However they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|Regardless of how they tried, it was obvious they could not convert these people.}}\n|}\n\nIf the two clauses cannot be swapped, a semicolon is required.\n\nA sentence or clause can also contain the word \'\'however\'\' in the middle, if it is an adverb meaning "although" that could have been placed at the beginning but does not start a new clause in mid-sentence. In this use, the word may be enclosed between commas. Example:\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| || {{xt|He did not know, however, that the venue had been changed at the last minute.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Meaning}}: || {{xt|However, he did not know that the venue had been changed at the last minute.}}\n|}\n\n===Hyphens===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:HYPHEN}}\n\n[[Hyphen]]s ({{xt|-}}) indicate conjunction.

Some words of these sorts are nevertheless common without the hyphen (e.g., {{xt|cooperation}} is more frequently attested than {{xtg|co-operation}} in contemporary English).{{efn|name=recent}}\n# To link related terms in [[compound modifier]]s:{{Efn|1=Specifically, compound [[attributive adjective|attributive]]s, which are modifiers of a noun that occur within the [[noun phrase]]. {{crossref|(See {{section link|English compound#Hyphenated compound modifiers}}.)}}}}\n#*Hyphens can aid ease of reading (that is, they can be {{xt|ease-of-reading}} aids) and are particularly useful in long noun phrases: {{xt|gas-phase reaction dynamics}}.

Where there would otherwise be a loss of clarity, however, a hyphen may be used in the predicative form as well ({{xt|hand-fed turkeys}}, {{xt|the turkeys were hand-fed}}). Awkward attributive hyphenation can sometimes be avoided with a simple rewording: {{xt|Hawaiian-native species}} → {{xt|native Hawaiian species}}.\n#*Avoid using a hyphen after a standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverb ({{xt|a newly available home}}, {{xt|a wholly owned subsidiary}}) unless part of a larger compound ({{xt|a slowly-but-surely strategy}}). In rare cases, a hyphen can improve clarity if a rewritten alternative is awkward, but rewording is usually preferable: {{!xt|The idea was clearly stated enough}} can be disambiguated as {{xt|The idea clearly was stated often enough}} or {{xt|The idea was stated with enough clarity}}.\n#*A few words ending in \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' function as both adjectives and adverbs ({{xt|a kindly-looking teacher}}; {{xt|a kindly provided facility}}). Some such dual-purpose words (like {{xt|early}}, {{xt|only}}, {{xt|northerly}}) are not standard \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' adverbs, because they are not formed by addition of \'\'{{nowrap|-ly}}\'\' to an independent current-English adjective. These need careful treatment: {{xt|Early flowering plants appeared around 130&nbsp;million years ago}}, but {{xt|Early-flowering plants risk damage from winter frosts}}; {{xt|only child actors}} (no adult actors) but {{xt|only-child actors}} (actors without siblings).\n#*A hyphen is normally used when the adverb \'\'well\'\' precedes a participle used attributively ({{xt|a well-meaning gesture}}; but normally {{xt|a very well managed firm}}, because \'\'well\'\' itself is modified) and even predicatively, if \'\'well\'\' is necessary to, or alters, the sense of the adjective rather than simply intensifying it ({{xt|the gesture was well-meaning}}, {{xt|the child was well-behaved}}, but {{xt|the floor was well polished}}).\n#*In some cases, such as {{xt|diode–transistor logic}}, the independent status of the linked elements requires an en dash instead of a hyphen. {{crossref|pw=y|See {{Section link||Dashes}}.}}\n#*{{shortcut|MOS:SUSPENDED|MOS:HANGING}}Use a \'\'\'[[suspended hyphen]]\'\'\' (also called a \'\'hanging hyphen\'\') when two compound modifiers are separated ({{xt|two- and three-digit numbers}}; {{xt|a ten-car or -truck convoy}}; {{xt|sloping right- or leftward}}).\n#*Values and units used as compound modifiers are hyphenated only where the unit is given as a whole word; when using the unit symbol, separate it from the number with a [[non-breaking space]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).\n\n<div class="block-indent" style="padding-left: 5em; padding-right: 0; overflow: hidden;"><!--The underlying code adapted from {{block indent}} which doesn\'t work around wikitables.-->\n{| style="background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|9-mm gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9&nbsp;mm gap}} (markup: <code>9&amp;nbsp;mm gap</code>)\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}}&nbsp; &nbsp; || {{!xt|9&nbsp;millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|9-millimetre gap}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12-hour shift}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|12&nbsp;h shift}} (markup: <code>12&amp;nbsp;h shift</code>)\n|}\n</div>\n\n\'\'\'Multi-word hyphenated items:\'\'\' It is often possible to avoid multi-word hyphenated modifiers by rewording ({{xt|a four-CD soundtrack album}} may be easier to read as {{xt|a soundtrack album of four CDs}}). This is particularly important where converted units are involved ({{xt|the 6-hectare-limit (14.8-acre-limit) rule}} might be possible as {{xt|the rule imposing a limit of six hectares (14.8 acres)}}, and the ungainly {{!xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) -long tributary}} as simply {{xt|4.9-mile (7.9&nbsp;km) tributary}}).\n\nFor optional hyphenation of compound \'\'\'points of the compass\'\'\' such as \'\'southwest/south-west\'\', see {{section link||Compass points}}.\n\nDo not use a capital letter after a hyphen except for a proper name following the hyphen: {{xt|Graeco-Roman}} and {{xt|Mediterranean-style}}, but not {{!xt|Gandhi-Like}}. In titles of published works, when given in [[title case]], follow the capitalization rule for each part independently ({{xt|\'\'The Out-of-Towners\'\'}}), unless reliable sources consistently do otherwise in a particular case ({{xt|\'\'The History of Middle-earth\'\'}}).\n\nHyphenation rules in other languages may be different. Thus, in French a place name such as {{xt|Trois-Rivières}} (\'Three Rivers\') is hyphenated, when it would not be in English. Follow reliable sources in such cases.\n\n\'\'\'Spacing:\'\'\' A hyphen is never followed or preceded by a space, except when hanging {{crossref|(see above)}} or when used to display parts of words independently, such as {{xt|the prefix sub-}}{{nbsp}}and {{xt|the suffix{{nbsp}}-less}}.\n\n\'\'\'Image filenames and redirects:\'\'\' Image filenames are not part of the encyclopedic content; they are tools. They are most useful if they can be readily typed, so they usually use hyphens instead of dashes. Similarly, article titles with dashes should also have a corresponding redirect from a copy of the title with hyphens: for example, {{xt|[[Michelson-Morley experiment]]}} redirects to {{xt|[[Michelson–Morley experiment]]}}.\n\n\'\'\'Non-breaking:\'\'\' A [[non-breaking hyphen]] ({{tlx|nbhyph}}) will {{em|not}} be used as a point of line-wrap.\n\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SHY|MOS:SOFTHYPHEN}}\n{{Anchor|shy}}\n\'\'\'Soft hyphens:\'\'\' Use [[soft hyphen]]s to mark locations where a word will be broken and hyphenated {{em|if necessary}} at the end of a line of text, usually in [[Longest English words|very long words]] or narrow spaces (such as captions, narrow table columns, or text adjacent to a very wide image), for example: {{tlx|shy|Penn|syl|va|nia and Mass|a|chu|setts style themselves com|mon|wealths.}}. Use sparingly to avoid making wikitext difficult to read and edit. For more information, see [[Help:Line-break handling#%3Cwbr /%3E and soft hyphens|Help:Line-break handling]].\n\n\'\'\'Encoding\'\'\': The hyphen is represented by the {{small|ASCII/UNICODE [[hyphen-minus|HYPHEN-MINUS]]}} character, which is entered by the hyphen or minus key on all standard keyboards. Do not use the {{small|[[Hyphen#Unicode|UNICODE HYPHEN]]}} character.\n\nHyphenation involves many subtleties that cannot be covered here; the rules and examples presented above illustrate the broad principles.\n\n=== Dashes<span id="Em dashes"></span><span id="Unspaced em dash"></span><span id="En dashes"></span><span id="Spaced en dash"></span> ===\n{{redirect|WP:DASH|the overview of Wikipedia discussions|Wikipedia:Dashboard}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:DASH|MOS:EMDASH|MOS:ENDASH}}\n\nTwo forms of dash are used on Wikipedia: \'\'\'[[en dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|–}}) and \'\'\'[[em dash]]\'\'\' ({{xt|—}}). To enter them, click on them in the [[Help:CharInsert|CharInsert toolbar]], or enter them manually as:\n*<code>&amp;ndash;</code> or <code>&amp;mdash;</code>\n*{{tlx|endash}} or {{tlx|emdash}}\nDo not use a double hyphen (<code>--</code>) to stand in for a dash. {{crossref|(See also: [[Wikipedia:How to make dashes]].)}}\n\nSources use dashes in varying ways. For consistency and clarity, Wikipedia adopts the following principles.\n\n====In article titles====\nIn [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article titles]], do not use a hyphen ({{xt|-}}) as a substitute for an en dash, for example in \'\'[[eye–hand span]]\'\' (since \'\'eye\'\' does not modify \'\'hand\'\'). Nonetheless, to aid searching and linking, provide a redirect with hyphens replacing the en dash(es), as in \'\'[[eye-hand span]]\'\'. Similarly, provide [[Template:Category redirect|category redirects]] for categories containing dashes. When an en dash is being used as a separator in an article title or section heading, editors may choose whether to capitalize what follows, taking into consideration [[#Retaining existing styles|the existing practice]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Consistent titling|consistency with related articles]].\n\n====In running text====\n{{Anchor|DASHVAR}}\nDashes are often used to mark divisions within a sentence: in pairs (parenthetical dashes, instead of parentheses or pairs of commas) or singly (perhaps instead of a colon). They may also indicate an abrupt stop or interruption in reporting quoted speech. In all such cases, either unspaced em dashes or spaced en dashes can be used, with consistency maintained throughout a given article:\n*An em dash is <em>unspaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected—but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\n*An en dash is <em>spaced</em> on both sides:\n{{Block indent|{{xt|Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.}}}}\nIdeally, an en dash should be preceded by a non-breaking space; this prevents the dash from appearing at the beginning of a line. The {{tlx|snd}} template may be used for this:\n{{Block indent|{{mxt|<nowiki>Another "planet" was detected{{snd}}but it was later found to be a moon of Saturn.</nowiki>}}}}\nDo not insert any spaces where an en dash should be unspaced {{crossref|printworthy=y|(see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}})}}.\n\nDashes can clarify a sentence\'s structure when commas, parentheses, or both are also being used.\n*{{xt|The book summarizes works of some major philosophers in chronological order: Descartes, Locke, Hume{{snd}}but not his \'\'Treatise\'\' (deemed too complex for the target audience){{snd}}and Kant.}}\n\n<span class="anchor" id="Spare the dash"></span>{{Shortcut|MOS:SPARETHEDASH|MOS:NOTRIPLEDASH}}\nUse dashes sparingly.

It is used to <em>join</em> components less strongly than a hyphen would {{crossref|(see {{section link||Hyphens}})}}; conversely, it may also <em>separate</em> components less strongly than a slash would {{crossref|(see {{Section link||Slashes}})}}. Consider the relationship that exists between two components when deciding what punctuation to place between them.\n\n====Other uses for em dashes====\nAn [[#Indentation|indented]] em dash may be used when attributing the source of a passage, such as a [[#Block quotations|block quotation]] or poem. This dash should not be fully spaced: however, for reasons related to [[Wikipedia:Reuse|metadata]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility|accessibility]], it is best to place a [[hair space]] between the dash and the name.{{efn|name=hairspace|The [[hair space]] should be done as {{mxt|{{tl|hair space}}}} because the actual Unicode character ({{hair space}}) is almost invisible, the meaning of the numerical HTML entity ({{!mxt|&amp;#8202;}}) is relatively obscure, and the named HTML entity "{{!mxt|&amp;hairsp;}}" is not standard and unsupported in some browsers.}} Most of Wikipedia\'s quotation templates provide this formatting automatically.\n\nFor example, {{mxt|{{tlp|in5}}—{{tl|hair space}}Charlotte Brontë}} will produce:\n\n{{in5}}—{{hair space}}Charlotte Brontë\n\n====Other dashes====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NEGATIVE}}\n\nDo not use [[Typewriter#Typewriter conventions|typewriter approximations]] or other substitutes, such as two hyphens ({{!xt|--}}), for em or en dashes.\n\nFor a negative sign or subtraction operator use {{Unichar|2212|MINUS SIGN|nlink=Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|html=}}, which can also be generated by clicking on the {{Code|−}} following the {{Code|±}} in the {{xt|Insert}} toolbar beneath the edit window. Do not use {{Unichar|2212}} inside a {{tag|math|o}} tag, as the character gives a syntax error; instead use a normal hyphen {{Unichar|002D}}.\n\n===Slashes (strokes)<span class="anchor" id="Slashes"></span>===\n{{redirect|WP:SLASH|information on subpages, which contain a slash in their titles|WP:SUB}}\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SLASH|MOS:STROKE|MOS:/}}\n\nGenerally, avoid joining two words with a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], also called a forward slash, stroke or solidus ({{xt|&nbsp;/&nbsp;}}), because it suggests that the words are related without specifying how. Replace with clearer wording.\n\nAn example: {{!xt|The parent/instructor must be present at all times.}} Must both be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent and the instructor}}.) Must at least one be present? (Then write {{xt|the parent or the instructor}}.) Are they the same person? (Use a hyphen: {{xt|the parent-instructor}}.)\n\nIn circumstances involving a distinction or disjunction, the en dash {{crossref|(see above)}} is usually preferable to the slash: {{xt|the digital–analog distinction}}.\n\nAn unspaced slash may be used:\n*to indicate [[phonemic]] [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation|pronunciations]] ({{xt|\'\'rivet\'\' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈrɪvət/}}}});\n*in a fraction (<code>7/8</code>, but see other techniques at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Fractions and ratios}});\n*to indicate regular defined yearly periods that do not coincide with calendar years (e.g., {{xt|the 2009/2010 fiscal year}}), if that is the convention used in reliable sources (see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Long periods of time}} for further explanation);\n*to express a ratio, in a form in which a slash is conventionally used (e.g., {{xt|the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio for short}});\n*in an expression or abbreviation widely used outside Wikipedia (e.g., {{xt|n/a}} or {{xt|N/A}} for \'\'not applicable\'\').\n\nA spaced slash may be used:\n*to separate run-on lines in quoted poetry or song ({{xt|To be or not to be: that is the question:&nbsp;/ Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer&nbsp;/ The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune}}), or rarely in quoted prose, where careful marking of a paragraph break is textually important;\n*to separate items that include at least one internal space ({{xt|the NY&nbsp;31 east&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;370 exit}}), where for some reason use of a slash is unavoidable.\n\nTo avoid awkward linebreaks, code spaced slashes (and fraction slashes) with a non-breaking space on the left and a normal space on the right, as in: <code>My mama told me&amp;nbsp;/ You better shop around</code>. For short constructions, both spaces should be non-breaking: {{nobr|<code>x&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;y</code>}}. On the other hand, if two long words are connected by an unspaced slash, an {{tl|wbr}} added after the slash will allow a linebreak at that point.\n\nDo not use the [[backslash]] character ({{!xt|&nbsp;\\&nbsp;}}) in place of a slash.\n\nPrefer the division operator ({{xt|&nbsp;÷&nbsp;}}) to slash or fraction slash when representing elementary arithmetic in general text: {{xt|{{nowrap|10 ÷ 2 {{=}} 5}}}}. In more advanced mathematical formulas, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] or slash is preferred: <math>\\textstyle\\frac{x^n}{n!}</math> or {{xt|{{var|x}}<sup>{{var|n}}</sup>/{{var|n}}!}} {{cross reference|1=(see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Common mathematical symbols}} and [[Help:Displaying a formula]])}}.\n\n====And/or====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:ANDOR}}\n\nAvoid writing {{!xt|and/or}} unless other constructions would be lengthy or awkward. Instead of {{!xt|Most had trauma and/or smoke inhalation}}, write simply {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation}} (which would normally be interpreted as an [[inclusive-or]] to imply \'\'or both\'\'); or, for emphasis or precision or both, write {{xt|trauma or smoke inhalation or both}}. Where more than two possibilities are present, instead of {{!xt|x, y, and/or{{nbsp}}z}} write {{xt|one or more of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}} or {{xt|some or all of x, y, and{{nbsp}}z}}.\n\n=== Symbols ===\nUnicode symbols are preferred over composed [[ASCII]] symbols for improved readability and accessibility.

If a quoted phrase or title ends in a question mark or exclamation mark, it may confuse readers as to the nature of the article sentence containing it, and so is usually better reworded to be mid-sentence. Where such a word or phrase occurs mid-sentence, new terminal punctuation (usually a period) must be added at the end.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Acceptable}}: || {{xt|Slovak returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?}}\n|-\n| {{em|Better}}: || {{xt|Slovak, having grown tired of What Is This?, returned to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1985.}}\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr..}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|He made several films with Sammy Davis Jr.}}\n|}\n\n===Punctuation and footnotes===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:CITEPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTFOOT|MOS:REFPUNCT|MOS:PUNCTREF|MOS:REFSPACE|MOS:PF}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Citing sources}}\n\'\'\'Reference tags\'\'\' ({{tag|ref}}) are used to create \'\'[[Help:Footnotes|footnotes]]\'\' (also called \'\'endnotes\'\' or simply \'\'notes\'\'), as [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Inline citations|citation footnotes]] and sometimes [[Help:Explanatory notes|explanatory notes]].

Adjacent reference tags should have no space between them, nor should there be any between tags and [[:Category:Inline templates|inline dispute and cleanup templates]].\n\nWhen reference tags are used, a [[Help:Footnotes#Creating the footnote list|footnote list]] must be added, and this is usually placed in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Notes and references|References]] section, near the end of the article in the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Standard appendices and footers|standard appendices and footers]].\n\n*<em>Example</em>: [[Flightless bird]]s have a reduced [[Keel (bird anatomy)|keel]],{{Dummy ref|10}} and they also have smaller wing bones than flying birds of similar size.{{Dummy ref|11}}{{Dummy ref|12}}\n\n\'\'\'Exceptions\'\'\': Reference tags are placed <em>before</em> dashes, not after.

See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics|Punctuation after formulae}}.\n\n==Dates and time==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Chronological items}}\n\nDates should be [[Wikipedia:Linking|linked]] only when they are germane and topical to the subject, as discussed at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking|Chronological items}}. For ranges of dates and times, see {{section link||Other uses for en dashes}}.\n\n===Time of day===\n{{Main|MOS:TIME}}\n\nTimes of day are normally expressed in figures rather than words. Context determines whether the [[12-hour clock|12-]] or the [[24-hour clock|24-hour]] format is more appropriate.\n*Twelve-hour clock times are written in one of two forms: {{xt|11:15&nbsp;a.m.}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;p.m.}}, or {{xt|11:15&nbsp;am}} and {{xt|2:30&nbsp;pm}} (wherein the spaces should be [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking]]). Use {{xt|noon}} and {{xt|midnight}} rather than {{!xt|12&nbsp;pm}} and {{!xt|12&nbsp;am}}; it may need to be specified whether \'\'midnight\'\' refers to the start or end of a date.\n*Twenty-four-hour clock times are written in the form {{xt|08:15}} and {{xt|22:55}}, with no suffix. Midnight written as {{xt|00:00}} begins the day; {{xt|24:00}} ends it.\n\n===Dates<span id="Choice of format"></span><span id="Days"></span>===\n{{Main|MOS:DATEFORMAT}}\n\nFull dates are formatted {{xt|{{nobr|10 June 1921}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10, 1921}}}}; or where the year is omitted, use {{xt|{{nobr|10 June}}}} or {{xt|{{nobr|June 10}}}}.\n*The dates in the \'\'text\'\' of any one article should all have the same format (day-first or month-first).\n**For date formats in citations, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Citation style}}.\n**Dates in quotations and titles are always left as-is.\n**If a numerical format is required (e.g., for conciseness in lists and tables), use the YYYY-MM-DD format: {{xt|{{nobr|2005-04-03}}}}.\n*Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the more common date format for that country (month-first for the US, except in military usage; day-first for most others; articles related to Canada may use either consistently). Otherwise, do not change an article from one date format to the other without good reason.\n\n===Months===\n{{Main|MOS:MONTH}}\n*For month and year, write {{xt|June 1921}}, with no comma.\n*Abbreviations for months, such as {{xt|Feb}}, are used only where space is extremely limited. Such abbreviations should use three letters only, and should not be followed by a period (full point) except at the end of a sentence.\n\n===Seasons===\n{{Main|MOS:SEASON}}\n*Avoid ambiguous references to [[seasons]], which are different in the southern and northern hemispheres.\n*Names of seasons may be used when there is a logical connection to the event being described ({{xt|the autumn harvest}}) or when referring to a phase of a natural yearly cycle ({{xt|migration typically starts in mid-spring}}). Otherwise, neutral wording is usually preferable ({{xt|He was elected in November 1992}}, not {{!xt|He was elected in the fall of 1992}}).\n*Journals and other publications that are issued seasonally (e.g., "Summer 2005") should be dated as such in citations {{crossref|(for more information, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Citing sources|Seasonal publication dates and differing calendar systems}})}}.\n\n===Years and longer periods===\n{{Main|MOS:DECADE|MOS:CENTURY|MOS:ERA}}\n*Do not use \'\'the year\'\' before the digits ({{xt|1995}}, not {{!xt|the year 1995}}), unless the meaning would otherwise be unclear.\n*Decades are written in the format {{xt|the 1980s}}, with no apostrophe. Use the two-digit form (\'80s) only with an established social or cultural meaning. Avoid forms such as {{!xt|the 1700s}} that could refer to ten or a hundred years.\n*Years are denoted by [[Anno Domini|AD and BC]] or, equivalently, [[Common Era|CE and BCE]]. Use only one system within an article, and do not change from one system to the other without good reason. The abbreviations are written without periods, and with a [[#Non-breaking spaces|non-breaking space]], as in {{xt|5&nbsp;BC}}. Omit AD or CE unless omitting it would cause ambiguity.\n\nMore information on all the above topics can be found at {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Chronological items}}, including the handling of dates expressed in different calendars, and times corresponding to different time zones.\n\n===Current===\n{{Main|MOS:CURRENT}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:As of|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Relative time references}}\n\nTerms such as "current", "now", and "recent"{{efn|name=recent}} should be avoided. What is current today may not be tomorrow; situations change over time. Instead, use date- and time-specific text. To help keep information updated use {{tlx|As of}}, which will allow editors to catalog and update dated statements.\n\n{| role="presentation" style="margin:0.2em 0 0.5em 1.6em; background:transparent;color: var( --color-base );"\n|-\n| {{em|Incorrect:}} || {{!xt|He is the current ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|-\n| {{em|Correct:}} || {{xt|As of March 2011, he is the ambassador to&nbsp;...}}\n|}\n\n==Numbers<span id="Spelling out numbers"></span>==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Numbers}}\n*Integers from zero to nine are spelled out in words. Integers greater than nine {{em|expressible in one or two words}} may be expressed either in numerals or in words. Other numbers are given in numerals or in forms such as {{xt|21{{nbsp}}million}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}}.\n*In general, in numbers with five or more digits to the left of the decimal point, use commas to group those digits. Numbers with four digits are at the editor\'s discretion: {{xt|12,345}}, but either {{xt|1,000}} or {{xt|1000}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Grouping of digits}}.\n*In general, use decimals rather than fractions for measurements, but fractions are sometimes used with [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[U.S. customary units|U.S. customary]] units. Keep articles internally consistent.\n*[[Scientific notation]] (e.g., {{xt|{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}}}) is preferred in scientific contexts. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|5.8|e=7|u=kg}}</nowiki></code>.\n*Write out "million" and "billion" on the first use. After that, unspaced "M" can be used for millions and "bn" for billions: {{xt|70M}} and {{xt|25bn}}. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Numbers as figures or words}} for similar words.\n*Write {{xt|3%}}, {{xt|three percent}}, or {{xt|three per cent}}, but not {{!xt|3{{nbsp}}%}} (with a space) or {{!xt|three{{nbsp}}%}}. "Percent" is American usage, and "per cent" is British usage {{crossref|(see {{section link||National varieties of English}})}}. In ranges of percentages written with an en dash, write only a single percent sign: {{xt|3–14%}}.\n*Indicate uncertainties as e.g., {{xt|{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}}}. Markup: <code><nowiki>{{val|1.534|0.35|e=23|u=m}}</nowiki></code>. See {{section link|MOS:NUM|Uncertainty and rounding}} for other formats.\n\n==Currencies==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Currencies and monetary values}}\n*Use the full abbreviation on first use ({{xt|US$}} for the US dollar and {{xt|A$}} for the Australian dollar), {{em|unless the currency is already clear from context}}. For example, the government of the United States always spends money in American dollars, and never in Canadian or Australian dollars.\n*Use only one symbol with ranges, as in {{xt|$250–300}}.\n*In articles that are not specific to a country, express amounts of money in [[United States dollars]], [[euros]], or [[pounds sterling]]. Do not link the names or symbols of currencies that are commonly known to English-speakers ({{xt|$}}, {{xt|€}}, {{xt|£}}), unless there is a particular reason to do so; do not use potentially ambiguous currency symbols, unless the meaning is clear in the context.\n*In country-specific articles, use the currency of the country. On first occurrence, consider including conversion to US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling, at a rate appropriate to the context. For example, {{xt|Since 2001 the grant has been 10,000,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] (€1.0M as of August 2009)}}. Wording such as "approx." is not appropriate for simple rounding-off of the converted amount.\n*Generally, use the full name of a currency, and link it on its first appearance if English-speakers are likely to be unfamiliar with it ({{xt|52 [[Nepalese rupee]]s}}); subsequent occurrences can use the currency sign (just {{xt|88 Rs}}).\n*Most currency symbols are placed {{em|before}} the number, and unspaced {{nobr|({{xt|$123}} not {{!xt|$ 123}}).}}\n\n==Units of measurement==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers#Units of measurement}}\n*The main unit in which a quantity is expressed should generally be an [[International System of Units|SI]] unit or [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|non-SI unit officially accepted for use with the SI]]. However,\n**Scientific articles may also use specialist units appropriate for the branch of science in question.\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United States, the main unit is generally a U.S. customary unit ({{xt|22 pounds (10 kg)}}).\n**In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United Kingdom, although the main unit is generally a metric unit ({{xt|10 kilograms (22 lb)}}), imperial units are still used as the main units in some contexts ({{xt|7 miles (11 km) by road}}).\n*Where English-speaking countries use different units for the same measurement, provide a conversion in parentheses. Examples: {{xt|the Mississippi River is {{convert|2320|mi|km|0}} long}}; {{xt|the Murray River is {{convert|2375|km|mi|0}} long}}. See {{tlx|convert}}.\n*In a direct quotation, always retain the source\'s units. Any conversion should follow in square brackets (or, an obscure use of units can be explained in the article text or a [[Wikipedia:Footnotes|footnote]]).\n*Where space is limited (such as tables, infoboxes, parenthetical notes, and mathematical formulas) unit symbols are preferred. In prose, unit names should be given in full if used only a few times but symbols may be used when a unit (especially one with a long name) is used repeatedly after spelling out the first use (e.g., {{xt|Up to 15 kilograms of filler is used for a batch of 250{{nbsp}}kg}}), except for unit names that are hardly ever spelled out ({{xt|°C}} rather than {{!xt|degrees Celsius}}).\n*Most unit names are not capitalized (see {{section link||National varieties of English}} for spelling differences).\n*Use "per" when writing out a unit, rather than a slash: {{xt|metre per second}}, not {{!xt|metre/second}}.\n*Units unfamiliar to general readers should be presented as a name–symbol pair on first use, linking the unit name ({{xt|Energies were originally 2.3 [[megaelectronvolt]]s (MeV), but were eventually 6{{nbsp}}MeV}}).\n*For ranges, see {{section link||En dashes: other uses}}, and MOS:NUM, at {{section link|nopage=y|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers|Date ranges|Percentages|Unit names and symbols|Formatting of monetary values}}.\n*Unit symbols are preceded by figures, not by spelled-out numbers. Values and unit symbols are separated by a [[non-breaking space]]. For example, {{xt|5&nbsp;min}}. The percent sign and units of degrees, minutes, and seconds {{em|for angles and coordinates}} are unspaced.\n\n==Common mathematical symbols==\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMONMATH}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics}}\n*For a negative sign or subtraction operator, use a minus sign ({{xt|−}}, Unicode character U+2212 <small>MINUS SIGN</small>). Input by clicking on it in the insert box beneath the edit window or by typing <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n*For multiplication, use a multiplication sign ({{unichar|d7|MULTIPLICATION SIGN}}) or a dot ({{unichar|22c5|DOT OPERATOR}}), which are input by clicking on them in the edit toolbox under the edit window or by entering <code>&amp;times;</code> or <code>&amp;sdot;</code>. Care should be taken not to confuse the dot operator (in the "Math and logic" section of the edit toolbox) with an interpunct (in the "Insert" section of the edit toolbox) or a bullet. The letter {{xt|x}} should not be used to indicate multiplication, but it is used (unspaced) as the substitute for "by" in terms such as {{xt|[[4x4]]}}.\n*[[Exponentiation]] is indicated by a superscript, {{xt|\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup>}} (typed as <code><nowiki>\'\'a\'\'<sup>\'\'n\'\'</sup></nowiki></code>.\n*Do not use programming language notation outside computer program text. In most programming languages, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation are represented by the [[hyphen-minus]] <code>-</code>, the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code>, and either the [[caret]] <code>^</code> or the double asterisk <code>**</code> respectively; [[scientific notation]] is replaced by [[E notation]].\n*Symbols for [[binary operator]]s and [[binary relation|relations]] are usually spaced on both sides:\n**plus, minus, and plus-or-minus (as binary operators): {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|5&nbsp;−&nbsp;3}});\n**multiplication and division: {{xt|×}}, {{xt|÷}};\n**equals, does not equal, equals approximately: {{xt|{{=}}}}, {{xt|≠}}, {{xt|≈}};\n**is less than, is less than or equal to, is greater than, is greater than or equal to: {{xt|<}}, {{xt|≤}}, {{xt|>}}, {{xt|≥}}.\n*Symbols for [[unary operator]]s are closed-up to their operand:\n**positive, negative, and positive-or-negative signs: {{xt|+}}, {{xt|−}}, {{xt|±}} (as in {{xt|−3}});\n**other unary operators, such as the exclamation mark as a [[factorial]] sign (as in {{xt|5!}}).\n*Variables are italicized, but digits and punctuation are not; only \'\'x\'\' and \'\'y\'\' are italicized in {{xt|2(5\'\'x\'\'&nbsp;+&nbsp;\'\'y\'\')<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*{{tlx|math}} can be used to style formulas to distinguish them from surrounding text.

In North American English, these words are almost invariably treated as singular; the major exception is that when a sports team is referred to by its short name, plural verbs are commonly used, e.g. {{xt|the [[Miami Heat|Heat]] are playing the Lakers tonight}}.\n\nNames of towns and countries usually take singular verbs (even when grammatically plural: {{xt|the United States is in North America}}, {{xt|the Netherlands is also known as Holland}}), but exceptionally in British English, typically when used to refer to a sports team named after a town or country or when discussing actions of a government, plural is used. For example, in {{xt|[[England national football team|England]] are playing [[Germany national football team|Germany]] tomorrow}}, \'\'England\'\' refers to a [[Association football|football]] team; but in {{xt|England is in the Northern hemisphere}}, it refers to the country.

While style guides with fewer than five years in print have not been in publication long enough to have had as much real-world impact as those from around 2000–2015 (on which MoS is primarily based), the corpora used for [[Google ngrams|Google {{var|n}}grams]] are updated through 2019, and we frequently [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#Some search engine tests|rely on]] what they indicate from the late 20th century and onward.}} reliable sources.

Exception: Do not expunge or replace names in source citations (whether as authors or mentioned in work titles).\n*Former names under which a living person was notable should be introduced with "born" or "formerly" in the lead sentence of their main biographical article. Name and gender matters should be explained at first appearance in that article, without overemphasis. In articles on works or other activities of such a person, use their current name by default, and give another name associated with that context in a parenthetical or footnote, only if they were notable under that name. In other articles, do not go into detail about such a person\'s name or gender except when directly relevant to the context.\n*Avoid confusing constructions by rewriting. Paraphrase, elide, or use square brackets to replace portions of quotations as needed to avoid confusion, former names, and mismatching gendered words.\n{{Crossref|printworthy=y|For examples and finer points, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography#Gender identity}}.}}\n\n===Non-English terms <span class="anchor" id="Foreign terms"></span> ===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NON-ENG|WP:!EN|MOS:FOREIGN}}\n{{See also|WP:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Other languages|WP:Manual of Style/Lead section#Foreign language|:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style (regional)|Help:Interlanguage links}}\n\n==== Terms without common usage in English <span class="anchor" id="No common usage in English"></span> ====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Non-English language terms}}\n\nNon-English terms should be used sparingly. In general, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Foreign terms|use italics]] for phrases and words that are not current in English. This is best done with the {{tlx|lang}} template using the appropriate [[ISO language code]], e.g., {{tlx|lang|es|casa}}. There are alternatives to the {{tnull|lang}} template which also provide additional information about a non-English word or phrase, such as a link to the language name; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see [[:Category:Wikipedia multilingual support templates]]}}. As Wikipedia does not apply italics to names of people, places, or organizations, the alternative template {{tlx|langr}} can be used to apply the language markup without italicizing.{{efn|This has the benefit of helping screen readers pronounce the name correctly. Such a proper name may be italicized when contrasting it with a conventional English form: {{xt|Munich ({{lang-de|München|link=no}})}}.}} Templates like {{tlx|lang}} automatically italicize text written using the Latin alphabet, so specifying italics is unnecessary. \n\nText written in non-Latin scripts such as Greek, Cyrillic, and Chinese should not be italicized or put in bold, as the difference in script is already sufficient to visually distinguish the text. Generally, any non-Latin text should include an appropriate romanization.\n\n====Terms with common usage in English====\n{{anchor|Common usage in English|reason=Old section name, surely has incoming links.}}\n[[Loanword]]s and borrowed phrases that have common usage in English{{snd}}{{xt|Gestapo}}, {{xt|samurai}}, {{xt|vice versa}}{{snd}}do not require italics.

If a particular romanization of the subject\'s name is [[Wikipedia:Article titles#Use commonly recognizable names|most common]] in English ({{xt|Tchaikovsky}}, {{xt|Chiang Kai-shek}}), that form should be used. Otherwise, the romanization of names should adhere to a particular widely used system for the language in question ({{xt|Aleksandr Tymoczko}}, {{xt|Wang Yanhong}}). \n\nThe use of [[diacritic]]s in non-English words is neither encouraged nor discouraged. Use generally depends on whether they appear in reliable English-language sources, though with some additional constraints imposed by site guidelines. Provide [[Wikipedia:Redirect#Alternative names and languages|redirects]] from alternative forms that include or exclude diacritics.\n\nProper names in languages written using the [[Latin alphabet]] can include letters with diacritics, [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], and other characters that are not commonly used in contemporary English. Wikipedia normally retains these special characters, except where there is a well-established English spelling that replaces them with English standard letters. Examples:\n* The name of the article on Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] is spelt with the [[double acute accent]], and the alternative spellings \'\'Paul Erdos\'\' and \'\'Paul Erdös\'\' redirect to that article.\n* Similarly, the name of the article on the Nordic god [[Ægir]] is so spelt, with redirects from the ligature-free form [[Aegir]] and the Swedish spelling [[Ägir]].\n* However, the region of Spain named {{lang|es|Aragón}} in Spanish and {{lang|ca|Aragó}} in Catalan is given as [[Aragon]], without the accent, as this is the established English name. Non-English forms with diacritics appear in the article\'s lead section.\nUse of diacritics is determined on a topic-by-topic basis; a [[Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus|small group of editors]] cannot prohibit or require the use of diacritics within a given class of articles.{{efn|1=See the near-unanimous [[Special:PermanentLink/496631631#RfC:_Can_a_wikiproject_require_no-diacritics_names,_based_on_an_organisation\'s_rule_or_commonness_in_English_press?|RfC]], repeated [[Special:PermanentLink/664830645|deletion]] at [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion]] of an anti-diacritics "wikiproject", the policy {{section link|Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels of consensus}}, and the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee]]\'s standardized [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Index/Principles 2#Levels of consensus|\'\'statements of principles\'\' on such matters]].}}\n\nSpell a name consistently in the title and the text of an article. {{crossref|(Relevant policy: [[Wikipedia:Article titles]]; see also [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]].)}} For a non-English name, phrase, or word, adopt the spelling most commonly used in English-language [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable sources|reliable sources]], including but not limited to those already cited in the article.{{efn|name=GScholar|1=Reputable English-language encyclopedias and dictionaries in the aggregate are often helpful in [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)#Widely accepted name|determining the most widely accepted spelling]] of a place name, loanwords, etc. It may also help ([[Wikipedia:Google test|within limits]]) to compare search results from the [[Google Scholar]] journal index, for topics likely to be covered in peer-reviewed academic papers.}} For punctuation of compounded forms, see relevant guidelines in {{section link||Punctuation}}.\n\n[[Proper and common nouns|Proper name]]s in non-English languages should generally not be italicized, unless another reason applies; such as with [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles of works#FOREIGNTITLE|titles of major published works]], e.g., [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|{{xt|{{lang|fr|Les Liaisons dangereuses}}}}]]; or when being compared to other names for the same subject in a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words|words-as-words]] manner, e.g., {{xt|\'\'\'Nuremberg\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Nürnberg}})}}. When non-English text should not be italicized, it can still be properly tagged by using the {{tlx|lang}} template with the {{para|italic|unset}} parameter: {{tlx|lang|de|italic{{=}}unset|Nürnberg}}.\n\nSometimes usage will be influenced by other guidelines, such as {{section link||National varieties of English}}, which may lead to different choices in different articles.\n\n====Other non-English concerns<span class="anchor" id="Other concerns"></span>====\n*For non-English vernacular names of species, see {{section link||Animals, plants, and other organisms}}.\n*For handling of quotations in languages other than English, see {{section link||Non-English quotations}}.\n*For non-English characters that resemble single quotation marks and apostrophes, see {{section link||Apostrophes}}.\n*For actual non-English quotation characters, see {{section link||Quotation characters}}.\n*For the capitalization in the titles of non-English language works, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Titles#Capitalization in foreign-language titles}}.\n*For linear and [[interlinear gloss]]es and their particular uses of small-caps (and italics and single quotes), see {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#All caps and small caps}}.\n\n===Technical language<span id="JARGON"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:JARGON}}\n{{redirect|Wikipedia:Jargon|an explanation of jargon used on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Glossary}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a manual, guidebook, textbook, or scientific journal|Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable}}\n\nSome topics are necessarily technical: however, editors should seek to write articles accessible to the greatest possible number of readers. Minimize the use of [[jargon]], and adequately explain its meaning when it is used. Overly technical material can be tagged with {{tlx|Technical}} or {{tlx|Technical-statement}}, so that it can be addressed by other editors. For topics that require a more technical approach, the creation of a separate introductory article (like [[Introduction to general relativity]]) may be a solution.\n\nExcessive \'\'wikilinking\'\' (linking within Wikipedia) can result from trying too hard to avoid putting explanations in parenthetical statements, like the one that appeared earlier in this sentence. Do not introduce specialized words simply to teach them to the reader when more widely understood alternatives will do. \n\nWhen the concepts underlying the jargon used in an article are too complex to explain concisely in a parenthetical, [[Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable#Write one level down|write one level down]]. For example, consider adding a brief background section with {{tlx|main}} tags pointing to articles with a fuller treatment of the prerequisite material. This approach is practical only when the prerequisite concepts are central to the exposition of the article\'s main topic and when such prerequisites are not too numerous. Short articles, such as [[Wikipedia:Stub|stubs]], generally do not have such sections.\n\n{{crossref|printworthy=y|For italicization and other markup of introduced terms, see: {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Words as words}}.}}\n\n===Geographical items===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:GEO|MOS:PLACE}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Abbreviations#Special considerations}}\n\n<section begin="MOS:GEO" />\'\'\'Geographical\'\'\' or \'\'\'place names\'\'\' are the nouns used to refer to specific places and geographic features. These names often give rise to conflict, because the same places are called different things by different peoples speaking different languages. Many place names have a historical context that should be preserved, but common sense should prevail. There can be few places that have not been parts of more than one culture or have had only one name. As proper nouns, all such place names (but not terms for types of places) [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Place names|have major words capitalized]].\n\nA place should generally be referred to consistently by the same name as in the title of its article {{crossref|(see [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]])}}. An exception may be made when there is a widely accepted historical English name appropriate to the given context. In cases where such a historical name is used, it should be followed by the modern{{efn|name=recent}} name in round brackets (parentheses) on the first occurrence of the name in applicable sections of the article. This resembles linking; it should not be done to the detriment of style. On the other hand, it is probably better to provide such a variant too often than too rarely. If more than one historical name is applicable for a given context, the other names should be added after the modern English name, that is: "historical name (modern name, other historical names)".\n\nThis is an English-language encyclopedia, so established English names are preferred if they exist, and spellings in non-English alphabets should always be transcribed into the Roman alphabet. In general, other articles should refer to places by the names which are used in the articles on those places, according to the rules described at [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)]]. If a different name is appropriate in a given historical or other context, then that may be used instead, although it is normal to follow the first occurrence of such a name with the standard modern name in parentheses.\n\nAt the start of an article, provide notable equivalent names from other languages, including transcriptions where necessary: \n:\'\'\'Cologne\'\'\' ({{lang-de|Köln|link=no}}, IPA: {{IPA|[kœln]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n:\'\'\'Mount Fuji\'\'\' ({{lang|ja|富士山}} {{translit|ja|Fuji-san}}, IPA: {{IPA|[ɸuʥisaɴ]}}) is the&nbsp;...\n\nNames in languages with no particular present-day or historical ties to the place in question (English excepted, of course) should {{em|not}} be listed as alternatives.\n\nAvoid anachronism. An article about [[Junípero Serra]] should say he lived in [[Alta California|Alta Mexico]], not in [[California]], because the latter entity did not yet exist in Serra\'s time. The Romans invaded [[Gaul]], not [[France]], and [[Thabo Mbeki]] was the president of the [[Republic of South Africa]], not of the [[Cape Colony]]. To be clear, you may sometimes need to mention the current name of the area (for example "in what is now France"), especially if no English name exists for that area in the relevant historical period.<section end="MOS:GEO" />\n\n==Media files==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Creation and usage of media files}}\n\n===Images===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:IM}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Images}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Images|Wikipedia:Image use policy|Wikipedia:Picture tutorial}}\n\n*Each image should be inside the level{{nbs}}2 section to which it relates, within the section defined by the most recent <code>==Heading==</code> delimited by two equal signs, or at the top of the lead section.

Redundant links (like the one in {{!xt|the tallest people on [[Earth]]}}) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that {{em|are}} worth pursuing should stand out clearly.\n\n\'\'\'Linking to sections\'\'\': A hash sign&nbsp;(<code>#</code>) followed by the appropriate heading will lead to a relevant part of a page. For example, <code><nowiki>[[Apostrophe#Use in non-English names]]</nowiki></code> links to a particular section of the article [[Apostrophe]].\n\n\'\'\'Initial capitalization\'\'\': Wikipedia\'s [[MediaWiki]] software does not require that wikilinks begin with an upper-case character. Capitalize the first letter only where this is naturally called for, or when specifically referring to the linked article by its name (see also related rule for [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Uses of italics that are specific to Wikipedia|italics in cross-references]]): {{xt|[[Snake]]s are often [[venomous]], but [[lizard]]s only rarely {{crossreference|(see [[Poison]])}}.}}\n\n\'\'\'Check links\'\'\': Ensure the destination is the intended one; many dictionary words lead to disambiguation pages and not to complete or well-chosen articles.\n\n===External links===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:External links}}\n\nExternal links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an \'\'External links\'\' section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. The standard format is a primary heading, <code>==External links==</code>, followed by a bulleted list of links. Identify the link and briefly indicate its relevance to the article. For example:\n\n{{Block indent|{{plain list|\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]</syntaxhighlight>\n*<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext" inline>*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]</syntaxhighlight>\n}} }}\n\nThese will appear as:\n\n{{Block indent|\n*[https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html History of NIH]\n*[https://nih.gov/ National Institutes of Health homepage]\n}}\n\nWhere appropriate, use [[:Category:External link templates|external link templates]] such as {{tlx|Official website}} and {{tlx|URL}}.\n\nAdd external links with discretion; Wikipedia is [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files|not a link repository]].\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n===Keep markup simple===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:MARKUP|MOS:SIMPLIFY}}\n[[File:Keep it Simple.jpg|right|90px]]\nOther things being equal, keep [[Help:Wiki markup|markup]] simple. This makes wikitext easier to understand and edit, and the results seen by the reader more predictable. Use HTML and CSS markup sparingly. See: [[KISS principle]].\n\nIn general, wikitext formatting is considered easier to use than HTML and wikitext is preferred if there are equivalents; see [[Help:HTML in wikitext]]. [[Wikipedia:HTML 5#Obsolete elements and attributes|Obsolete elements and attributes]] should be updated or removed. There are many templates that allow HTML markup to be used without putting it in articles directly, such as {{tl|em}} (see [[MOS:EMPHASIS]]) and {{tl|strong}} (see [[MOS:BOLD]]).\n\nAn [[Character entity reference|HTML character entity]] is sometimes better than the equivalent Unicode character, which may be difficult to identify in edit mode; for example, <code>&amp;Alpha;</code> is explicit whereas <code>&Alpha;</code> (the upper-case form of Greek <code>α</code>) may be misidentified as the Latin <code>A</code>.\n{{further|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Best practice: wiki markup and CSS classes}}\n\n===Formatting issues===\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting}}\n\nModifications in font size, blank space, and color {{crossref|(see {{section link||Color coding}})}} are an issue for the Wikipedia site-wide [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheet]] and should be reserved for special cases only.\n\nTypically, the use of custom font styles:\n*reduces consistency, as the text no longer looks uniform;\n*reduces usability, as it may be impossible for people with custom style sheets (e.g. for accessibility reasons) to override it, and may clash with a different [[Skin (computing)|skin]] or inconvenience people with color blindness {{crossref|(see below)}}; and\n*causes disputes, as other editors may disagree aesthetically with the choice of style.\n\nSpecify font sizes {{em|relatively}} (for example with <code>font-size: 85%</code>) rather than {{em|absolutely}} (like <code>font-size: 8pt</code>). The resulting font size of any text should not drop below 85% of the page\'s default font size.\n\n====Color coding====\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Color}}{{Shortcut|MOS:COLORCODING}}\n\nDo not use color {{em|alone}} to mark differences in text: they may be invisible to people with [[color blindness]] and useless in black-and-white printouts or displays.\n\nChoose colors such as [[maroon|<span style="background: white; color: maroon">maroon</span>]] and [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]] that are distinguishable by readers with the most common form of colorblindness, and {{em|additionally}} mark the differences with change of font or some other means ([[maroon|<span style="background: white; font-family: Georgia, serif; color: maroon; font face: Times New Roman">maroon and alternative font face</span>]], [[teal|<span style="background: white; color: teal">teal</span>]]). Avoid low contrast between text and background colors. See also [[color coding]].\n\nEven for readers with unimpaired color vision, excessive background shading of table entries impedes readability and recognition of Wikilinks. Background color should be used only as a {{em|supplementary}} visual cue and should be subtle (consider using lighter, less-dominant [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] hues) rather than glaring.\n\n====Indentation<span class="anchor" id="INDENT"></span><span class="anchor" id="Indent"></span><span class="anchor" id="indenting"></span>====\n{{Shortcut|MOS:INDENT}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}}\n\nDo not use quotation templates to indent non-quotations. Various templates are available for indentation, including {{tlx|block indent}} to indent an entire block and {{tlx|in5}} to indent inline.\n\nDo not use <code>:</code> ([[description list]] markup) to indent text in articles, even though it is common on talk pages. It causes accessibility problems and outputs invalid HTML. {{Crossref|See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Indentation}} for alternatives.}}\n\n===Controlling line breaks<span id="Non-breaking spaces"></span>===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:NBSP}}\n{{See also|Help:Line-break handling|Template:Spaces}}\n\nIt is sometimes desirable to force a text segment to appear entirely on a single line{{mdashb}}that is, to prevent a line break (line wrap) from occurring anywhere within it.\n*A \'\'\'[[non-breaking space]]\'\'\' (or \'\'\'hard space\'\'\') will never be used as a line-break point. Markup: for {{xt|19{{nbsp}}kg}}, code <code>19&amp;nbsp;kg</code> {{em|or}} <code>19{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>.\n*Or use {{tlx|nowrap}}, {{tlx|nobreak}}, or {{tlx|nobr}} (all equivalent). Markup: for {{xt|{{nobr|5° 24′ N}}}}, code {{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ N}}.\n\nIt is desirable to prevent line breaks where breaking across lines might be confusing or awkward. For example:\n{{columns list|colwidth=15em|\n*<code>17{{t|nbsp}}kg</code>\n*<code>AD{{t|nbsp}}565</code>\n*<code>2:50{{t|nbsp}}pm</code>\n*<code>£11{{t|nbsp}}billion</code>\n*<code>May{{t|nbsp}}2014</code>\n*{{tlx|nobr|5° 24′ 21″ N}}\n*<code>Boeing{{t|nbsp}}747</code>\n*<code>123{{t|nbsp}}Elm Street</code>\n*<code>World War{{t|nbsp}}II</code>\n*<code>Pope Paul{{t|nbsp}}VI</code>\n*<code><nowiki>\'\'</nowiki>E.{{t|nbsp}}coli<nowiki>\'\'</nowiki></code>\n}}\n\nWhether a non-breaking space is appropriate depends on context: whereas it is appropriate to use <code>12{{t|nbsp}}MB</code> in prose, it may be counterproductive in a table (where an unattractive break may be acceptable to conserve precious horizontal space) and unnecessary in a short parameter value in an infobox (where a break would never occur anyway).\n\nA line break may occur at a \'\'\'thin space\'\'\' (<code>&amp;thinsp;</code>, or {{tlx|thinsp}}), which is sometimes used to correct too-close placement of adjacent characters. To prevent this, consider using {{tlx|nobr}}.\n\nInsert non-breaking and thin spaces as [[named character reference]] (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;thinsp;</code>), or as templates that generate these ({{tlx|nbsp}}, {{tlx|thinsp}}), and never by entering them directly into the edit window from the keyboard{{snd}}they are visually indistinguishable from regular spaces, and later editors will be unable to see what they are. Inside wikilinks, a construction such as {{nobr|<code><nowiki>[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]</nowiki></code>}} works but {{nobr|<code>[[World War{{t|nbsp}}II]]</code>}} doesn\'t.\n\n===Scrolling lists and collapsible content===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:SCROLL|MOS:COLLAPSE|MOS:DONTHIDE}}\n{{Redirect|WP:COLLAPSE|the guideline on collapsing off-topic talk page discussions|WP:TALKOFFTOPIC}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support}}\n\nElements that can selectively display or hide content can interfere with the ability of readers to access said content. These mechanisms include [[Help:Scrolling list|scrolling list]]s, and templates like {{tlx|collapse}} that can be toggled between collapsed and uncollapsed states using a {{bracket|{{midsize|hide{{\\}}show}}}} button. These mechanisms should not be used to conceal "[[Wikipedia:Spoiler|spoiler]]" information. Templates should generally [[Wikipedia:Template namespace#Guidelines|not be used to store article text]] at all, as it interferes with editors\' ability to find and edit it. Moreover, content in an article should <em>never</em> be collapsed by default. This applies equally to content in [[Wikipedia:Citing sources#Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Tables|tables]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Embedded lists|embedded lists]], [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Image galleries|image galleries]], and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Captions|image captions]].\n\nIf such mechanisms are used, care must be taken to ensure the content remains accessible for all users, including [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility#Users with limited CSS or JavaScript support|those with limited CSS or JavaScript support]]. What\'s more, careless use of collapsible templates will impact accessibility for the <em>clear majority</em> of readers (more than 60%) who use the [[Help:Mobile access|mobile version of the site]],{{efn|1=See [[Template:Navbox visibility]].}} which does not support collapsing and will either completely uncollapse or completely hide the content within the template. The usability of the mobile site is  easy to test with the "Mobile view" link at the bottom of each page.{{efn|1=The "Mobile sidebar preview" tool near the bottom of [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets]] permits live preview. The "Mobile view" page-bottom feature shows the article only as it currently exists; if using that, and considering a change that could have mobile accessibility implications, please save the change first in a [[Wikipedia:User pages#Subpages|user sandbox]] and test the mobile version of that. The mobile website can also be accessed by changing a page\'s URL from <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> to <code>en.m.wikipedia.org</code>. Note that the "desktop" version of the site being viewed on a mobile device is distinct from the <em>mobile version</em> of the site. However, checking the desktop site on a mobile device may be a worthwhile for some broader accessibility matters, especially on tablets, which do not always use the mobile version of Wikipedia.}}\n\nWhen hiding content is desired, it must be done using the <code>collapsible</code> parameter of relevant templates, or manually-added CSS classes <code>mw-collapsed</code>, and <code>autocollapse</code> (see [[Help:Collapsing]]). Other methods of hiding content should not be used, as they may render content inaccessible to many users, such as those browsing Wikipedia with [[JavaScript]] disabled, browsing the mobile version,{{efn|Collapsing content using those classes does not work in the mobile version, where such content is simply always shown. However, applying, or using a template that applies, any of the following CSS classes will cause the affected content to be inaccessible to mobile users, and this list may not be exhaustive: <code>navbox</code>, <code>mbox-image</code>, <code>vertical-navbox</code>, <code>nomobile</code> are from <code>[https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-mediawiki-config/blob/master/wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php#L17056 wgMFRemovableClasses]</code>. No top icons are displayed, so <code>topicon</code> is missing.}} or using proxy services such as [[Google Web Light]].\n\nCollapsed or auto-collapsing \'\'cells\'\' or \'\'sections\'\' may be used with tables if they simply repeat information covered in the main text (or are purely supplementary, e.g., several past years of statistics in collapsed tables for comparison with a table of uncollapsed current stats). Auto-collapsing is often a feature of [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates#Navigation templates|navboxes]]. A few [[Wikipedia:Infobox|infoboxes]] also use pre-collapsed sections for infrequently accessed details. If information in a list, infobox, or other non-navigational content seems extraneous or trivial enough to inspire pre-collapsing it, consider raising a discussion on the article (or template) talk page about whether it should be [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|included at all]]. If the information is important and the concern is article density or length, consider [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Layout#Body sections|dividing the article into more sections]], integrating [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Trivia sections|unnecessarily list-formatted information]] into the article prose, or [[Wikipedia:Summary style|splitting the article]].\n\n===Invisible comments===\n{{Shortcut|MOS:COMMENT}}\n{{redirect|WP:COMMENT|the expression of personal opinions in articles|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought}}\n{{for|invisible control characters|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Private Use Area and invisible formatting characters}}\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Hidden text}}\n\nEditors use "invisible" comments{{snd}}not shown in the rendered page seen by readers of the article, but visible in the source editing mode when an editor opens the article for editing{{snd}}to communicate with one another.\n\nInvisible comments are useful for alerting other editors to issues such as common mistakes that regularly occur in the article, a section title\'s being the target of an incoming link, or pointing to a discussion that established a consensus relating to the article. They should not be used to instruct other editors not to perform certain edits, which could be perceived as expressing a form of [[WP:OWN|ownership]] over an article, although where existing local consensus is against making an edit they may usefully draw the editor\'s attention to that. Avoid adding too many invisible comments because they can clutter the wiki source for other editors. Check that your invisible comment does not change the formatting, for example by introducing unwanted white space in the rendered page.\n\nTo leave an invisible comment, enclose the text you intend to be read only by editors between <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>. For example:\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;If you change this section title, also change the links to it on the pages&nbsp;...&nbsp;|wrap=yes}} {{small|(there are bots which can do this, see [[MOS:RENAMESECTION]])}}\n*{{tag|!--|content=&nbsp;When adding table entries, remember to update the total given in the text.&nbsp;|wrap=yes}}\nThis notation can be inserted with a single click in [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]], just under the edit pane in edit mode.\n\n===Pronunciation===\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Pronunciation}}\n\n\'\'\'Pronunciation\'\'\' in Wikipedia is indicated in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). In most situations, for ease of understanding by the majority of readers and across variants of the language, [[Phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|quite broad]] IPA transcriptions are best for English pronunciations. See [[Help:IPA/English]] and [[Help:IPA]] (general) for keys, and {{tlx|IPA}} for templates that link to these keys. For English pronunciations, [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|pronunciation respellings]] may be used {{em|in addition to}} the IPA.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wikipedia:Editing policy|Editing policy]] –
