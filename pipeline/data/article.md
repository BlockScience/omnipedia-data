The **Jersey Act** was a regulation introduced to prevent the
registration of most American-bred
[Thoroughbred](Thoroughbred "wikilink") horses in the British _[General
Stud Book](General_Stud_Book "wikilink")_. It had its roots in the
desire of British horse breeders to halt the influx of American-bred
[racehorses](horse_racing "wikilink") of possibly impure bloodlines
during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported
to Europe to race and retire to a [breeding](horse_breeding "wikilink")
career after a number of U.S. states [banned
gambling](Gambling_in_the_United_States#History "wikilink"), which
depressed Thoroughbred racing---and thus breeding---in the United
States. The loss of breeding records during the [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink") and the late beginning of the
registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the [British
racing](Horse_racing_in_Great_Britain "wikilink") establishment to doubt
that the American-bred horses were purebred.

In 1913, the [Jockey Club](Jockey_Club "wikilink") and the owners of the
_General Stud Book_ passed a regulation named by the foreign press after
the Jockey Club\'s senior steward, [Lord
Jersey](Victor_Child_Villiers,_7th_Earl_of_Jersey "wikilink"),
prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their
ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders,
the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors
influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses
in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the
unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World
War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American
bloodlines had receded far back in most horses\' ancestry.

## Background

Before the introduction in 1913 of what became popularly known---\"with
questionable taste\" according to a correspondent writing in _[The
Times](The_Times "wikilink")_---as the Jersey Act,[^1] Thoroughbred
horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the _General Stud Book_,
the [stud book](Breed_registry "wikilink") for British and Irish
Thoroughbreds. The rules allowed a horse to be registered if all of the
horse\'s ancestors were registered in the _General Stud Book_ or if it
had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was registered in the
stud book of its country of origin.[^2] Overall the _General Stud Book_
had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the
time, around 1900; other countries, including the United States, France,
Australia and Russia, were considered by the British and Irish to be
much laxer and to have allowed some non-Thoroughbred horses into their
national stud books.[^3]

The [outlawing of race-track
betting](Gambling_in_the_United_States#History "wikilink") in parts of
the United States between 1900 and 1913 led to a large influx of
American-bred horses into Britain and Ireland, giving rise to fears
among British breeders that they would be swamped by the American
bloodlines and their own stock would become worthless.[^4] The biggest
state to outlaw betting was New York, which passed the [Hart--Agnew
Law](Hart–Agnew_Law "wikilink") in 1908.[^5] By 1911, the average price
for [yearlings](<Yearling_(horse)> "wikilink") sold at auction was at a
record low of \$230
(\$`{{formatnum:{{inflation|US|230|1911|r=-1}}}}`{=mediawiki} as of
`{{CURRENTYEAR}}`{=mediawiki}).[^6] Before 1900, most horses were
imported into Britain to race, and rarely stayed for a breeding career.
The outlawing of gambling resulted in large numbers of American horses
that could no longer be supported, and many were shipped to Europe for
racing. Because of the downturn in the horse market in the United
States, it was assumed that most of the horses sent to Europe would stay
there permanently and, after retirement from the racetrack, would enter
their breeding careers outside of the United States.[^7][^8] Between
1908 and 1913, over 1,500 Thoroughbreds were exported from the United
States. Those exported included 24 horses who had been or would later
become champions -- among them [Artful](Artful "wikilink"),
[Colin](<Colin_(horse)> "wikilink"), [Henry of
Navarre](<Henry_of_Navarre_(horse)> "wikilink"), [Peter
Pan](Peter_Pan_I "wikilink"), and
[Ballot](<Ballot_(horse)> "wikilink").[^9]

The _[American Stud Book](American_Stud_Book "wikilink")_, the
registration book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until
1873, much later than the _General Stud
Book_,[^10]`{{efn|The first volume of the ''General Stud Book'' appeared in 1791.<ref name=TB96>Willet ''Thoroughbred'' p. 96</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}
and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five
generations of ancestors in the _American Stud Book_ or other national
stud books, unlike the _General Stud Book_ rules.[^11] In addition, many
breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as
fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred
breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in
1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the
_General Stud Book_ rules. Adding to the problem was the fact that
American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England,
starting with [Iroquois](<Iroquois_(horse)> "wikilink"), who won the 1881
[Epsom Derby](Epsom_Derby "wikilink").[^12]

[J. B. Haggin](James_Ben_Ali_Haggin "wikilink"), an American breeder and
owner of [Elmendorf Farm](Elmendorf_Farm "wikilink"), had begun to ship
large contingents of horses to England for sale, including the
[1908](1908_Grand_National "wikilink") [Grand
National](Grand_National "wikilink") steeplechase winner
[Rubio](<Rubio_(horse)> "wikilink"), and the fear was that if other
American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be
overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began to
limit the number of training licences at [Newmarket
Racecourse](Newmarket_Racecourse "wikilink"), turning away a number of
American breeders.[^13] The _General Stud Book_ rules for registration
were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose
ancestry could be traced entirely to horses already registered in the
_General Stud Book_, but horses registered in other national stud books
were still allowed to be imported and registered.[^14]

## Introduction

The owners of the _General Stud Book_,
[Weatherbys](Weatherbys "wikilink"), consulted with the Jockey Club, the
United Kingdom\'s racing authority, and discussions were held about the
problems in pedigrees recorded in the _American Stud Book_.[^15] At a
meeting of the Jockey Club in spring 1913, [Victor Child Villiers, Lord
Jersey](Victor_Child_Villiers,_7th_Earl_of_Jersey "wikilink"), the
club\'s senior steward, proposed a resolution limiting the registration
of American bloodlines.[^16] It passed unanimously in May,[^17] and a
new regulation was placed in the _General Stud Book_, Volume 22:[^18]
`{{quote|No horse or mare can, after this date, be considered as eligible for admission unless it can be traced without flaw on both [[Horse breeding#Terminology|sire's and dam's]] side of its pedigree to horses and mares themselves already accepted in the earlier volumes of the book.<ref name=QClassic71>Quoted in Willett ''Classic Racehorse'' pp. 71–72</ref>{{efn|Admission means registration in this instance.}}}}`{=mediawiki}

Although named the Jersey Act by a critical foreign press, after Lord
Jersey,[^19] the new regulation did not have the force of law as it was
promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse,
not by the United Kingdom government.[^20][^21][^22] Nor was it
promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over
registration, only over racing matters.[^23] The regulation required
that any horse registered in the _General Stud Book_ trace in every line
to a horse that had already been registered in the _General Stud Book_,
effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.[^24]

## Effects

![An 1857 engraving of
Lexington](Lexington1.jpg "An 1857 engraving of Lexington") Because the
new rule was not applied retroactively, all American-bred horses
registered before 1913 remained on the register, and their descendants
were also eligible for registration.[^25] Of the 7,756 mares in Volume
27 of the _General Stud Book_, published in 1933, 930 would have been
ineligible under the new rule.[^26] The Jersey Act did have an immediate
impact however, as the winner of the 1914 Epsom Derby, [Durbar
II](<Durbar_(horse)> "wikilink"), was ineligible for registration, as his
dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible
for the _General Stud Book_.[^27]

The main problem for American breeders was the presence of the blood of
[Lexington](<Lexington_(horse)> "wikilink") in their breeding programs.
Lexington\'s pedigree on his dam\'s side was suspect in the eyes of
British racing authorities, and, as he had been the leading sire of
racehorses in the United States for 16 years, his descendants were
numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least
once,[^28][^29] and he was not the only horse with suspect bloodlines
registered in the _American Stud Book_.[^30]

Most British breeders thought the regulation necessary and welcomed it,
whereas most American breeders found it insulting, and believed that it
was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market.[^31] The
rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well, though,
including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, [Lord
Coventry](George_Coventry,_9th_Earl_of_Coventry "wikilink"), whose
successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration.[^32]
Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition,
probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States
on the domestic horse market.[^33] The American [Jockey
Club](<Jockey_Club_(United_States)> "wikilink") did not even remark on the
Jersey Act in its official publication, the _Racing Calendar_, and no
mention of it appears in the Jockey Club\'s meeting minutes for 1913.[^34] Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New
York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of
racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had
rebounded and was booming.[^35]

The Jersey Act did not prevent the racing of horses containing the
banned bloodlines, as horses with the suspect breeding raced and won in
England, but they were considered to be \"half-bred\". A number of
American-bred horses carrying the lines of Lexington had already been
imported into England, including
[Americus](<Americus_(horse)> "wikilink"), [Rhoda B](Rhoda_B "wikilink"),
and [Sibola](Sibola "wikilink"), and because they were [grandfathered
in](grandfather_clause "wikilink"), they and their descendants were
allowed to be registered in the _General Stud
Book_.[^36]`{{efn|Americus was an ancestor of [[Mumtaz Mahal (horse)|Mumtaz Mahal]], herself an ancestor of [[Nasrullah (horse)|Nasrullah]]. Sibola was an ancestor of [[Nearco]]. Both of these stallions were very influential in Thoroughbred breeding.<ref name=Breeders277>Hewitt ''Great Breeders'' p. 277</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}
Nor did it prevent the racing of horses that were not registered in the
_General Stud Book_; it just prevented registration in the _General Stud
Book_.[^37] American bloodlines, whether registered in the _General Stud
Book_ or not, dominated English racing in the 1920s and 1930s.[^38]
Horses that were ineligible for _General Stud Book_ registration, but
were allowed to race, were identified with a [Maltese
cross](Maltese_cross "wikilink") in programs and auction listings.[^39]

A number of American breeders, including the then-chairman of the
American Jockey Club, [William Woodward
Sr.](William_Woodward_Sr. "wikilink"), lobbied hard throughout the 1930s
to have the regulation removed.[^40] Woodward, and other defenders of
the American bloodlines, argued that the racing performance of the
horses proved their purity, even if they could not produce papers that
did so.[^41] Woodward declared in 1935 that \"If we do not get together,
we will grow apart.\"[^42] Those arguing for keeping the Jersey Act in
effect pointed out that the _General Stud Book_ is a record of
bloodlines, not a work recording racing ability.[^43]

The Jersey Act\'s major effect was the opposite of what was intended. In
the years before the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had
relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding
lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were
beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive
inbreeding.[^44] Additionally, by the end of the war American-bred lines
were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively
making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them
second-rate,[^45][^46] and harming the rebuilding of English
racing.[^47] There were even calls for the creation of an international
stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any
perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the _General
Stud Book_.[^48]

## 1949 amendment

Weatherbys, publishers of the _Stud Book_, approached the Jockey Club in
1948 to ask if it agreed that the Jersey Act was \"too
restrictive\".[^49] The rule was subsequently modified in June
1949,[^50] after the racing careers of a number of horses such as
[Tourbillon](<Tourbillon_(horse)> "wikilink") and
[Djebel](Djebel "wikilink") persuaded the Jockey Club to
reconsider.[^51]`{{efn|Tourbillon's maternal grandsire was [[Durbar (horse)|Durbar II]], who won the 1914 Epsom Derby and was the first winner of the Derby to be ineligible for the ''General Stud Book''.<ref name=BBR648/>}}`{=mediawiki}
A number of French-bred Thoroughbreds began to race in England after the
Second World War, but because they carried American lines they were
considered half-breds. In 1948 two of England\'s five [classic
races](British_Classic_Races "wikilink") were won by half-bred horses,
[My Babu](My_Babu "wikilink") and [Black
Tarquin](Black_Tarquin "wikilink"), prompting the Jockey Club to amend
the rule in the preface to the _General Stud Book_,[^52] to state that:
`{{quote|Any animal claiming admission from now onwards must be able to prove satisfactorily some eight or nine crosses pure blood, to trace back for at least a century, and to show such performances of its immediate family on the Turf as to warrant the belief in the purity of its blood.<ref name=QClassic73>Quoted in Willett ''Classic Racehorse'' p. 73</ref>{{efn|Crosses means generations of a pedigree, in this case that the pedigree goes back eight or nine generations.}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The amendment removed the stigma of not being considered purebred from
American-bred horses.[^53] A major consideration was that by the late
1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most
horses\' ancestry that it no longer made much sense to exclude them.
Neither did it make much sense to exclude some of the most successful
racehorses in Europe from registration.[^54] Weatherby\'s further
amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word \"thoroughbred\"
to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the _General
Stud Book_.[^55] In 2006, [Blood-Horse
Publications](Blood-Horse_Publications "wikilink"), publisher of _[The
Blood-Horse](The_Blood-Horse_magazine "wikilink")_ magazine, chose the
\"repeal\" of the Jersey Act as the 39th most important moment in
American Thoroughbred horse racing history.[^56]
